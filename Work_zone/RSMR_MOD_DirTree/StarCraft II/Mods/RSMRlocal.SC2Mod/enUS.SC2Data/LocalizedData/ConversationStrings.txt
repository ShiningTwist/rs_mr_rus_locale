Conversation/Protoss01/Group00002=Arrival at Antioch
Conversation/Protoss01/Group00003=Tutorial
Conversation/Protoss01/Group00004=Fenix Kills Something
Conversation/Protoss01/Group00005=remember
Conversation/Protoss01/Line00001=En Taro Adun, Executor. I am Judicator Aldaris, and I have been sent by the Conclave to serve and counsel you. The former Executor, Tassadar, was commanded to halt the Zerg progress in the Terran sector by burning the infested human worlds.
Conversation/Protoss01/Line00002=Unfortunately, he disregarded his orders and attempted to destroy the Zerg while sparing the Terrans from the flame. Clearly, Tassadar has failed us. You must not.
Conversation/Protoss01/Line00003=The Conclave has dictated that our first priority is to strengthen our defenses. You must reinforce our outpost in Antioch and make certain that the province does not fall to the Zerg. Your old comrade, Praetor Fenix, will meet you there and assist you in this endeavor.
Conversation/Protoss01/Line00004=Ah, Executor! En Taro Adun! It is good to see you once more upon the field of battle. I feared we would be left to protect the province with no reinforcements. I should not have questioned the Conclave's judgement so hastily!
Conversation/Protoss01/Line00005=Alas, all of our Probes were lost in the last Zerg attack, and we had no resources with which to replace them.
Conversation/Protoss01/Line00006=I had intended to construct Photon Cannons here for defense, but without Probes, we could not do so.
Conversation/Protoss01/Line00007=Our Gateway has no power. We must build a Pylon near it, so that our forces can be brought to this place.		
Conversation/Protoss01/Line00008=You know, Executor, although we two have marched across hundreds of worlds together, I never imagined that we would be fighting on Aiur. The Zerg are indeed worthy foes.	
Conversation/Protoss01/Line00009=Hahaha, I was remembering the time we faced the Tagal on Dannuth VII. They outnumbered us thirty to one that day, yet we overcame their legions like true Templar, just as we shall overcome our foes today! Ah, I wish Tassadar could be here with us.		
Conversation/Protoss02/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/Protoss02/Group00002=Fenix
Conversation/Protoss02/Group00003=Victory
Conversation/Protoss02/Line00001=En Taro Adun, Executor. Your defense of Antioch has restored my faith in the Templar caste. I admit that Tassadar's desertion had shaken my faith.
Conversation/Protoss02/Line00002=Indeed, Aldaris? I would hope that the Judicator would put more faith in their Templar brethren.
Conversation/Protoss02/Line00003=Tassadar! Where have you been?
Conversation/Protoss02/Line00004=Be silent, Judicator. There is no time to waste, and I have much to tell you. As you know, the Zerg vanished after the fall of the Terran world of Tarsonis, and though the Conclave bid me return home, I was compelled to remain.
Conversation/Protoss02/Line00005=A powerful psionic call drew my attention to a remote, barren world named Char. Apparently, the call was answered by others as well. For upon Char, I encountered those who were once our brethren - the Dark Templar.
Conversation/Protoss02/Line00006=Consorting with the Fallen Ones is heresy!
Conversation/Protoss02/Line00007=Enough! Hear me, Executor, for I have learned much from the Dark Templar Prelate, Zeratul.
Conversation/Protoss02/Line00008=The Overmind controls its minions through agents called Cerebrates. Strike down the Cerebrates, and the Swarms will surely fall.
Conversation/Protoss02/Line00009=Executor, Tassadar may be right. If you can keep the Zerg occupied, my force may be able to penetrate their perimeter and slay the abomination.
Conversation/Protoss02/Line00010=I pray we can trust you, Tassadar. Already I can sense the taint of the Fallen Ones' influence on your mind. You must return to Aiur at once!
Conversation/Protoss02/Line00011=My concern is for the safety of Aiur, not the judgments of the Conclave. I will return when the time is right.
Conversation/Protoss02/Line00012=Executor, we are in position. I await your orders.
Conversation/Protoss02/Line00013=I will remain behind and observe the effects of our attack. Return to the Citadel. I shall notify you when the Brood becomes erratic.
Conversation/Protoss03/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/Protoss03/Group00002=Victory
Conversation/Protoss03/Line00001=Executor, I bring news most dire. The Cerebrate that we thought we had killed has arisen again. The creature's battered form was reincarnated, despite the considerable damage we inflicted upon it. Even now, the Cerebrate drives its Brood in preparation for their next offensive.
Conversation/Protoss03/Line00002=It is as I feared. It was folly to believe Tassadar could be trusted. The Conclave will not soon forget his wanton betrayal. Nevertheless, we must stand resolute. For attacking defenseless Cerebrates is not the way of true Protoss warriors! We shall overcome the entire Swarm with the might and the fury that is our heritage!
Conversation/Protoss03/Line00003=Executor, we shall lead our main strike force to the province of Scion which has fallen to the Zerg. It's time the Zerg felt the wrath of the Sons of Aiur! Praetor Fenix will remain here with a small detachment and guard Antioch from any further assaults.
Conversation/Protoss03/Line00004=Adun be with you, Executor. Bring swift death to the enemies of Aiur.
Conversation/Protoss03/Line00005=Executor! Antioch is under attack by overwhelming Zerg forces!
Conversation/Protoss03/Line00006=Praetor, you must hold your position for as long as possible. Fight on, brave Fenix. And know that the gods watch over you. En Taro Adun!
Conversation/Protoss04/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/Protoss04/Group00002=Tassadar Scene
Conversation/Protoss04/Group00003=Victory
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00001=Executor, I know that you were reluctant to leave Aiur in this dark hour, and that you still grieve for the loss of your comrade, Fenix. But remember that he lived and died as a Templar. He has reached the Khala's end. There is no greater glory than that.
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00002=We Judicator are called to look beyond such matters; to ensure the safety and future of our people. It is not the Zerg, but the rogue Tassadar, who represents the greatest threat to us now.
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00003=If he is allowed to spread the Dark Templar's tainted influence to Aiur, all will be lost. We will find him and bring him to judgment.
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00004=Tassadar claimed that this world was abandoned by the Zerg just prior to the invasion of Aiur. Yet, I still sense a lingering darkness here. Be prepared for anything, Executor. If there are still Zerg on this world, then they must surely know of our arrival.
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00005=Aldaris? Executor? How is it that you've come here? I was about to abandon all hope of rescue!
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00006=I have come to arrest you and bring you home to Aiur to stand trial.
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00007=Arrest me? Aiur burns at the touch of the Zerg, and you travel all this way to arrest me?
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00008=Don't let it get to you, man. This happened to me once...
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00009=Who is this human, Tassadar?
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00010=The name's Jim Raynor, pal. And I won't be talked down to by anybody. Not even a Protoss.
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00011=Amusing... Tassadar, your taste in companions grows ever more inexplicable. Executor, prepare to take Tassadar into custody.
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00012=Executor, wait. I do not know what they have told you about me, but what I have done, I have done for Aiur. Help me find Zeratul and his Dark Templar. They alone can defeat the Overmind's Cerebrates. Once we have won I shall gladly submit myself to the judgement of the Conclave.
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00013=Unthinkable! You presume that we would side with the Dark Ones as you have? You have gone quite mad, Tassadar.
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00014=You shall speak of them with respect, Aldaris. Executor, there is much that I can explain to you, if only you'll help me find Zeratul.
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00015=We've been surrounded!
Conversation/Protoss04/Line00016=You have my thanks, Executor. Now let us find Zeratul and speed our way home.
Conversation/Protoss05/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/Protoss05/Group00002=Duke
Conversation/Protoss05/Group00003=ExtraHeroBanter
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00001=Executor, by following Tassadar and attempting to rescue the Dark Templar, you have openly defied the will of the Conclave. Abandon this mad scheme now, and the Conclave may show you mercy.
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00002=Don't let him control you, Executor. The Judicator have long since steered the actions of the Templar to their own ends. It's time we acted of our own accord.
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00003=Ah, Tassadar, have you fallen so far? To think that you were our brightest hope; our most beloved son. Now you are everything that we are not. You are lost to us. Not only have you damned yourself, but you have damned those who have followed you.
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00004=Such is the price for our race's salvation, Judicator! I have been here, with the Dark Templar, these last few months. While I helped them in their fight against the Zerg, I learned many of their secrets from their Prelate, Zeratul.
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00005=Apparently, the energies which empower the Dark Templar also course through the Overmind and its Cerebrates.
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00006=The same Cerebrate which you told us to destroy. Your advice was useless, for the creature was reincarnated before our eyes!
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00007=Unfortunately, yes. Your attack on the Cerebrate failed because the energies that you wield are useless when used directly against the Overmind and its Cerebrates.
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00008=Only the Dark Templar's power can truly harm the Zerg. That is why we must rescue Zeratul and return him to Aiur!
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00009=You were warned, Executor. The Conclave will not be pleased.
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00010=Protoss Commander, this is General Edmund Duke of the Terran Dominion Armada. You are in violation of our air-space and have endangered human lives in your reckless attack against the Zerg. I order you to withdraw your ships immediately. If you fail to comply, I will not hesitate to open fire upon your vessels.
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00011=General Duke, I am Tassadar, and you are well known to me. Whatever leniency I extended to you and your comrades before, may have been in error. If you persist in halting our course, we will burn your pathetic fleet down to the last man.
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00012=I'm going to have to assume that was a hostile response...
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00013=The Protoss are here!
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00014=To hell with you!
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00016=Prepare your defenses Tassadar!  I will come for you soon...
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00017=You cease to amuse me.
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00018=It was folly of you to come here!
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00019=Heh…I'll show you what the Zerg are really capable of.
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00020=I am the Queen of Blades and my stare alone would reduce you to ashes!
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00021=Now Protoss, you shall know my wrath!
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00022=Now you will know the fury of the Queen of Blades!
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00023=Insufferable Protoss...
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00024=Jim, you shouldn't have come here…
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00025=Damn!
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00026=I'm positive I didn't hear that right…
Conversation/Protoss05/Line00027=You and your ilk cease to amuse me.

Conversation/Protoss06/Group00005=Teleport
Conversation/Protoss06/Group00006=ExtraHeroBanter
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00001=Executor, I sense that Zeratul and his brethren are close by. But I have been unable to make contact with them. I fear they may be in grave danger. We must scour this area immediately and find the Dark Templar, lest they be overcome by the Zerg.
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00002=That won't be easy, man. That's Kerrigan down there leading those Zerg. She won't let us go without a fight.
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00003=I know, my friend. With all due respect to you, and to the feelings you once had for her, you must know that I will not hesitate to destroy her should she pose a threat to us. Nothing shall prevent me from delivering the Dark Templar to Aiur. Nothing.
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00004=Greetings, Dark One. I have come to bring you home.
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00005=Greetings to you, mighty Tassadar. I knew that you would not forsake us. For in the time that you have spent with us, you have learned to value our ways and our methods. You have learned to channel our dark power as well as that of your masters; thus, you alone have found completeness beyond the scope of the Khala. But I fear that the Conclave, in its pride, could never bring itself to welcome outcasts such as we.
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00006=Outcasts though you may be, it is your vision and courage that may yet save our Homeworld from the Swarm.  I beg of you, Zeratul,  return with us to Aiur.  Though they are petty, and have, in ignorance cursed your kind for generations... help me save our people.
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00007=Since our banishment long ago, we have never failed in our responsibility to Aiur.  Though it shall cause us great pain to see our homeland once more, we shall return with you, Tassadar.  We will  do what we can.
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00008=Mind if we tag along?
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00009=Need a light?
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00010=We gotta move!
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00011=Did you hear that?
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00012=Teleportation field activated.
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00013=Well done Tassadar!  But you really shouldn't have attempted this stunt.
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00014=Damn!  Don't do this!
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00016=I don't have time for games!
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00018=Then let our actions speak for us!
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00019=Oh come on Jim.  I will do as I see fit.  Don't be so squeamish.
Conversation/Protoss06/Line00020=Gentlemen, we'll need to finish this conversation later.  We'll be seeing each other again…real soon…
Conversation/Protoss07/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/Protoss07/Group00002=Intro
Conversation/Protoss07/Group00003=Victory
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00001=Greetings Executor! And greetings to you, Tassadar. I am overjoyed to see you both return home in this dark hour. The Zerg have redoubled their efforts, and it seems-
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00002=Fenix? It can't be! The Executor told me of how you fell before the Zerg. How is it that you live and breathe?
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00003=Ha hah... Well, after my unfortunate defeat, my ruined body was recovered by our brethren. I now reside within the cold, robotic shell of a Dragoon.
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00004=Old friend-would that this never came to pass...
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00005=Nonsense! There is no shame in defeat so long as the spirit is unconquered, and I am still able to serve Aiur to a degree. But enough of this.
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00006=There is much you both need to know. You have been branded as traitors by Aldaris and the Conclave. Even now they seek to arrest you and execute the Dark Templar, Zeratul.
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00007=I never believed that they would go so far. In the face of total annihilation they still cling to their failing traditions!
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00008=Yes, and that makes them all the more dangerous. They hunt you even now, Tassadar. And though I damn myself by doing so, I shall stand by you till the end.
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00009=En Taro Adun, noble Fenix. Executor, it seems that if our world is to live, we must protect the Dark Templar from our own brethren. Although it pains me greatly, not even the Conclave shall stand in our way.
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00010=Executor, you and the traitor Tassadar are to cease your resistance and surrender yourselves to the judgment of the Conclave. We will take the outlaw, Zeratul, into custody and deal with him as is written by the Khala's law.
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00011=Flee back to your masters, Aldaris, and huddle with them in darkness! For your actions shall set us all unto the Zerg!
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00012=Executor! Aldaris! This madness must stop! The sight of my brethren slaughtering one another is more than I can stand. Though I fear you would doom us all, Aldaris, I surrender myself to the Conclave. En Taro Adun, Executor. Don't give up the fight!
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00013=Tassadar of the Templar, by your actions you have severed yourself from the mercy of your brethren. You refused to destroy the Terran worlds as was commanded. You have questioned time and time again, the sacred will of the Conclave. And you have abandoned your Homeworld in its darkest hour. Most grievous of all is that you have allied yourself with the blasphemous Dark Ones, and learned to utilize their profane powers in tandem with our own! What say you, oh fallen Templar?
Conversation/Protoss07/Line00014=Aldaris, I submit myself to the Conclave's judgment. But know this, given the same choices again, I would surely have made them. I have sacrificed all that our world might live. I have sullied my honor, I have discarded my rank and standing, and I have even broken our own most ancient traditions. But never think that I would, for one moment, regret my actions. For I am Templar, and above all else, I have sworn to Protect our Homeworld 'till the end.

Conversation/Protoss08/Group00003=Victory
Conversation/Protoss08/Line00001=En Taro Adun, Executor. All seems lost now, but still we must fight on. We must find Tassadar and secure his release from the Judicator before they can execute him for treason. Without him, I fear there is no way to defeat the Zerg and their Overmind.
Conversation/Protoss08/Line00002=Zeratul and his Dark Templar have vanished, leaving us to fend for ourselves. I wonder if Tassadar was mistaken to have put his trust in them. We are receiving a transmission from Captain Raynor's command ship.
Conversation/Protoss08/Line00003=This is Raynor. I'd like to help if I can. Tassadar laid it on the line for me and my crew on Char. I'd like to repay the debt. Besides, I'm a long way from home, surrounded by hostile aliens. I've got to do something.
Conversation/Protoss08/Line00004=Then you shall, bold human. You shall.
Conversation/Protoss08/Line00005=Executor, we have found Tassadar's Stasis Cell. We will attempt to free him now.
Conversation/Protoss08/Line00006=I expected you to attempt to retrieve your hero. You will learn that the will of the Conclave is absolute. Make peace with Adun.
Conversation/Protoss08/Line00007=Stay thy hand, Judicator. The stewards of Tassadar shall not fall while the Dark Templar live. Call off your guards and stand aside, and you may yet live to see another moonrise.
Conversation/Protoss08/Line00008=I will not be addressed so by one so devoid of the Khala's light. You and your vile brethren shall die with these traitors.
Conversation/Protoss08/Line00009=Are you truly so blinded by your vaunted religion, that you can't see the fall ahead of you? Your Conclave believes that they are winning this war, but all they've succeeded in doing is helping the Overmind to win.
Conversation/Protoss08/Line00010=What could you possibly know about our designs, blasphemer?
Conversation/Protoss08/Line00011=You speak of knowledge, Judicator? You speak of experience? I have journeyed through the darkness between the most distant stars. I have beheld the births of negative-suns and borne witness to the entropy of entire realities... Unto my experience, Aldaris, all that you've built here on Aiur is but a fleeting dream. A dream from which your precious Conclave shall awaken, finding themselves drowned in a greater nightmare.
Conversation/Protoss08/Line00012=We shall see...
Conversation/Protoss09/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/Protoss09/Line00001=En Taro Adun, Executor! My gratitude to you, for having secured my release, knows no bounds. By all the gods, we may win yet! The time has come to let loose the fury of the Dark Templar. Zeratul, perhaps the time has come to tell our friends of the foe we face.
Conversation/Protoss09/Line00002=Indeed. When I slew the Cerebrate on Char, I touched briefly with the essence of the Overmind. In that instant, my mind was filled with its thoughts, and I tell you now our worst fears have come true.
Conversation/Protoss09/Line00003=The Zerg were indeed created by the ancient Xel'Naga, the same beings that empowered us in our infancy. But the Overmind grew beyond their constraints, and has at last come to finish the experiments they began so long ago.
Conversation/Protoss09/Line00004=So you see my friends, we fight not only to save Aiur, but all creation! If we fall to the Zerg then the Overmind will run rampant throughout the stars, consuming all sentience-all life. It is up to us to put an end to this madness, once and for all.
Conversation/Protoss09/Line00005=Our forces shall engage the primary Zerg Hive clusters in an attempt to weaken their defenses. Once their numbers have thinned out, Zeratul and his companions can infiltrate the clusters and assassinate the Cerebrates. Adun willing, the Cerebrates' deaths will distract the Overmind long enough for us to assault it directly.
Conversation/Protoss10/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/Protoss10/Group00002=Intro
Conversation/Protoss10/Group00003=Victory
Conversation/Protoss10/Line00001=Executor, our plan worked perfectly. The Zerg defenses are broken, and the way to the Overmind is laid bare! The time for our stand has come.
Conversation/Protoss10/Line00002=Indeed. My friends, this is our final hour. Not all of us may survive the coming conflict. Yet, death may be a blessing should we fail here. We seek now to destroy a foe that has ravaged its way across the universe consuming all in its path.
Conversation/Protoss10/Line00003=And now it has reached the end of its long journey. The Overmind has come to destroy all that we hold dear and assimilate us into itself. And I say to thee, this shall not come to pass! Aiur shall not fall! Executor, I stand ready!
Conversation/Protoss10/Line00004=As do I.
Conversation/Protoss10/Line00005=Well, I guess all I have left is to see this through. The Zerg have taken everything from me: my home, my family, my friends. I know that nothing I do can bring those things back, but I'll be damned if I just sit on my hands and wait for the end. I want a piece of 'em, all right. I'm in.
Conversation/Protoss10/Line00006=Then let our actions speak for us! For Adun! For Aiur!
Conversation/Protoss10/Line00007=Executor. Tassadar. This comes too late to you.  But the Conclave has witnessed your defeat of the Cerebrate. They know now that they cannot deny the necessity or the valiancy of your actions.  We sought to punish you, while it was we who were in error. You represent what is greatest in us all, and all our hopes go with you. EN TARO ADUN, brave Sons of Aiur!
Conversation/Protoss10/Line00008=Wow. Does that mean they're goin' ta send some back-up for us?
Conversation/Protoss10/Line00009=Executor, the Overmind has been weakened, but I fear we have sustained severe damage ourselves. I will steer the Gantrithor into a collision course with the Overmind. If I can channel enough of the Dark Templars' energy through the hull of the Gantrithor, I should be able to bring swift death to the accursed abomination. Remember us, Executor. Remember what was done here today. May Adun watch over you.

Conversation/ProtossX01/Group00006=To Battle
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00001=Greetings, Executor. Though we all grieve for the loss of mighty Tassadar, we must find the resolve to carry on. He sacrificed himself to destroy the Overmind, but many Zerg still rage across our ruined homeworld. Without the Conclave to lead us, or the protection of our great fleets, it seems we must fend for ourselves.
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00002=Aldaris is correct, Executor. As we have both seen, the Zerg will not halt their rampage until every last one of us is dead. I suggest that we retreat to our last functional warp gate and travel to where the Zerg cannot follow us.
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00003=With all due respect, Zeratul, the Protoss do not run from their enemies. Aiur is our homeworld. It is here that we shall make our stand!
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00004=Just as your Conclave did? They are dead now, Aldaris, dead because they allowed their pride to blind their reason. Only if we learn from their mistakes can we live to avenge them. Now, Executor, I know of a place where we can find solace. It is Shakuras, the secret homeworld of my people the Dark Templar.
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00005=Your people? We would be seen as tyrants to them! Why would they shelter us?
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00006=Have I not pledged myself to your cause? Not all beings are as unforgiving as your lamented Conclave, Aldaris.
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00007=You are right, of course. Executor, Zeratul shall find us passage to the warp gate. After the gate has been secured, Fenix and the new Praetor Artanis shall lead our surviving brethren to Shakuras.
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00008=Executor, I am Artanis. Though I have only recently been appointed Praetor, you can trust that I will uphold the honor and traditions of the Templar.
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00009=We shall see.
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00010=Hey boys, mind if we tag along? I figure headin' anywhere's got to be better than stayin' here with the Zerg!
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00011=Commander Raynor. <n/>As ever, your assistance is appreciated. We would be honored if you joined us.
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00012=Ah, it is good to see more of our brethren on the battlefield.	
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00013=En Taro Adun, Zeratul! This is all that remains of our forces in this province. We have found the location of the warp gate, but there is a sizeable Zerg force blocking the way.
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00014=We should destroy these nydus canals so as to stem the flow of Zerg reinforcements through them.		
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00015=Executor, I have located the warp gate.  We must hurry and evacuate the Khalai survivors before the Zerg return!		
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00016=Just worry about getting your people through the gate,  Executor. Fenix and I will hang back and protect our flank until everyone is through.		
Conversation/ProtossX01/Line00017=En Taro Adun! There is no time to waste. We must join our brethren in battle.

Conversation/ProtossX02/Group00005=No sign of them
Conversation/ProtossX02/Group00006=Victory
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00001=En Taro Tassadar, Executor. The survivors from Aiur have made it safely through the gate. Yet, amidst the chaos of our retreat we lost contact with Fenix and Raynor. I fear that they may have been overrun by the Zerg.
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00002=Fear not, Artanis. Fenix is as stalwart a warrior as I have ever known, and the Terran Raynor has proven himself to be highly resourceful in the past. I for one believe that they made it here safely. But while we wait for word from them, we must reconnoiter the surrounding area and find a suitable location for a more permanent settlement. Once we're situated we can begin to search for the Dark Templar.
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00003=Executor! There are Zerg on Shakuras! They must have taken control of the warp gate on Aiur!
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00004=Neraz Gulio!

Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00006=Zerashk gulida!
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00007=Adun Toridas, Zeratul! Glad I am to see that you've returned home after these many decades. But the strange guests that have followed you here seem ill-tempered.
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00008=Well met, my brother! Indeed, these creatures known as the Zerg have no regard for the sanctity of life. Once we have secured this area, I shall tell you everything I know about them in council.	
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00009=I am sure the Matriarch will be eager to hear your tale as well.
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00010=Executor! We have received a transmission from Raynor and Fenix! They are still alive, and are fighting to retake the warp gate on Aiur! We must secure the gate on this side without delay!
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00011=There is no sign of Fenix or Raynor. They must still be on Aiur!
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00012=Executor, my crew and I will remain here on Aiur and shut the gate down on this side. It's the only way to make sure that the Zerg won't send more reinforcements to Shakuras.
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00013=You will be hopelessly outnumbered, and once the gate is shut down there will be no one to save you should you be overrun.
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00014=Yeah, well... I'm a man of action. What can I say?
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00015=I shall remain with Raynor as well, Executor. My duty is to Aiur, after all.
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00016=Farewell then, brave warriors. We will send through all the troops we can spare.
Conversation/ProtossX02/Line00017=Thanks. You kids just remember to play nice from now on, ok? Wish us luck.
Conversation/ProtossX03/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/ProtossX03/Group00002=Start
Conversation/ProtossX03/Group00003=Use Dark Templar
Conversation/ProtossX03/Group00004=Victory
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00001=I am Raszagal, Matriarch of the Dark Templar, and I welcome you and your companions to our world. Zeratul has informed me of the fall of Aiur, and I am deeply grieved. I am one of the few Dark Templar old enough to remember our ancestral home with clarity. Yet, no matter how tragic the circumstances, it is clear that fortune has reunited our people. We Dark Templar will never forget our banishment from Aiur, nor the Conclave's sins against us. But you and your companions are no longer of the Conclave. The example set by your fallen hero, Tassadar, has shown you that when the light and dark sides of our energies are united, our power is undeniable.
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00002=But Matriarch, the Zerg who have followed us here are unlike any enemy the Protoss have ever known!
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00003=You speak the truth, Judicator. And yet, there lies a dormant power here that can help us to scour the Zerg from Shakuras forever. Long ago, we Dark Templar were a nomadic people. But when we found a remarkable monument upon this world, we decided to remain here to study it. We discovered that the enormous structure is actually an ancient Xel'Naga Temple, dedicated to the race that sired us all. The Temple is situated above a nexus of powerful cosmic energies. If we were to access those energies...
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00004=Then we should strike now while the Zerg still muster their forces!
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00005=Alas, we cannot. In order to properly channel the energies of the Temple, we will need the twin crystals, Uraj and Khalis, that legends say were separated many ages ago. The Uraj is laced with pure Templar energies, while the Khalis is comprised of Dark Templar energy. Only by using these two crystals in unison, can we hope to channel the potent energies of the Temple.
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00006=Then it is clear that we must retrieve these crystals wherever they may be.
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00007=Agreed. But first, we must deal with the Zerg and their two Cerebrates who have already taken up station around the Temple itself. To arms, my children! Scour the Temple grounds of this foul infestation!
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00008=Remember, young Templar, cerebrates can be killed only by Dark Templar weapons and energies. My brethren will make short work of any cerebrate!
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00009=Executor, our sensors show that the two Cerebrates are surrounded by spore colonies.  We will deploy our Corsairs to compensate for their defenses.
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00010=Executor! Our weapons are having little effect on this cerebrate! How are we to destroy these vile creatures?
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00012=Well done, mighty Protoss! I'm glad to see that you all are as violent as ever.
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00013=Kerrigan! What mockery is this?
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00014=Relax, warriors. Despite what you may think, I haven't come here to fight you.
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00015=This is laughable! Do you truly expect us to believe that your intentions here are honorable? That these Zerg here are not under your sway?
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00016=Look, the Cerebrates you've killed were my enemies as well. If you let me explain, I'm sure you'll understand tha-
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00017=You are the enemy of all who live, Kerrigan. What makes you think we would have anything to do with you?
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00018=Because, Zeratul, I bring news of an event that threatens us all. If you'd be so good as to escort me back to your Citadel, I'll tell you everything I know.
Conversation/ProtossX03/Line00019=Very well, Kerrigan. We shall hear what you have to say. But be warned: We will not suffer your treachery here.

Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00001=Now then, Kerrigan. Perhaps you had best explain yourself. What is this news you've come to give?
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00002=There is a new Overmind growing on Char.
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00003=What? Impossible! Why should we believe anything you have to say?
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00004=Because, Zeratul, I'm no longer the mindless murderess whom you fought on Char. The Overmind is dead. Whatever warped control it once had over me is gone. I know that this is a lot to take in all at once, but you've got to believe me! There's more at stake here than-
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00005=She lies! She is infested to the core! I for one will not listen to any of this...
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00006=Silence, Judicator. Continue, Kerrigan.
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00008=Apparently, many of the renegade Cerebrates, commanded by Daggoth, have merged into a new Overmind. Fortunately, the creature is still in its infant stages. It can't control the Swarm yet, but Daggoth and the others still have control over most of the Broods. The two Cerebrates you killed here were part of Daggoth's forces.<n/>Look, I don't need to tell you all what might happen if that thing reaches maturity. I can guarantee you that should it awaken, it'll take full control of me just like it did before. I don't want that to happen, and I'm pretty sure you don't want it to happen either.
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00009=Even if what you say is true, our priority is to save this world, not assault the new Overmind! We must find the crystals Uraj and Khalis before we are all vanquished.
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00010=Then I'll help you with your search. If you can defeat the renegade Zerg gathered here, it'll weaken the efforts of Daggoth and his ilk.
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00011=My children, you must put aside your fears and misgivings to accomplish what must be done. For the time being, Kerrigan will assist you in your endeavors. Though she has been your enemy, it is enough that we share the same agenda now. Allow her time enough to prove herself to you, and you may find her to be a valued ally. For now, you must focus on the task at hand. Search for the Uraj on the planet Braxis, and let nothing stop you from recovering it.
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00012=We will do what you ask, Matriarch. But you cannot expect us to forgive Kerrigan's crimes against our race! Executor, prepare our forces. We shall debark for the planet Braxis before the next moonrise.
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00013=Explain something to me, Zeratul. Why would your people leave such a sacred crystal in the hands of these Terrans?
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00014=We didn't. Long ago, this world was a Protoss colony called Khyrador. When the strife between our tribes escalated, this planet and the Uraj Crystal were abandoned. These Terrans have come here only recently.
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00015=Executor, we have a problem. Our warp matrix was damaged during transit. Because of the extensive damage, we will be unable to warp-in stargates to this location!
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00016=The Crystal's here, boys! Send in a probe to gather it up and our work here is done.
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00017=You have done well, Kerrigan. There is more to you than it seems. Perhaps I have misjudged you.
Conversation/ProtossX04/Line00018=Given our history, I can't say I blame you. Let's just get the job done.

Conversation/ProtossX05/Group00002=Generator
Conversation/ProtossX05/Line00001=Executor! Our sensors have just identified a large group of Terran vessels. However, their configuration profile is unlike any Terran group yet encountered. We are receiving a transmission from the fleet's command ship, identifying itself as the Aleksander.
Conversation/ProtossX05/Line00002=Protoss Commander, I am Admiral Alexei Stukov of the United Earth Directorate. We are here to take control of the Terran Dominion and all of its outlying colonies. You are in direct violation of Terran space and have openly attacked Terran troops. Lower your shields and power down your weapons systems. The UED will be taking custody of your ships and whatever spoils you have garnered from this planet.
Conversation/ProtossX05/Line00003=United Earth Directorate? Raynor spoke of the distant Terran homeworld called Earth. These humans have come a long way to make war on us.
Conversation/ProtossX05/Line00004=Have faith, Zeratul! You almost sound as if you fear these humans. What are they to such as we? Was it not we who defeated the dreaded Overmind?
Conversation/ProtossX05/Line00005=Yes, Artanis. We did vanquish the Overmind. But we did so with the help of humans. Do not be so quick to underestimate them.
Conversation/ProtossX05/Line00006=Of course. Executor, I shall test the mettle of these humans by scouting ahead of your ships, and finding a way through this blockade!<n/><n/>En Taro Tassadar!
Conversation/ProtossX05/Line00007=Executor, with the power generator destroyed, the missile turrets on this platform are no longer operational. However, we will need reinforcements to finish the job.
Conversation/ProtossX05/Line00008=Reinforcements are en route now, young Templar.

Conversation/ProtossX06/Group00003=Victory
Conversation/ProtossX06/Line00001=Executor, the Uraj is secured and the UED has given up the chase. We are currently holding perimeter orbit over the planet Char. Zeratul, have you locked onto the location of the Khalis?
Conversation/ProtossX06/Line00002=Yes. I remember sensing its power the last time I was on this world. However, our sensors indicate a massive, fluctuating energy signature at its location. I am, however, unable to identify the signature's source.
Conversation/ProtossX06/Line00003=That should be obvious, gentlemen; the source is the Overmind itself. When the Cerebrates merged together, they must have locked onto the Khalis' energies and nested near it. It's probable that there'll be a number of Broods protecting that area. It's risky, but if we can strike hard and fast, we might be able to fight our way through their defenses and escape with the crystal.
Conversation/ProtossX06/Line00004=Comrades, I may have an alternative. Seeing as how the Overmind is still in its infant stages, I wonder if we might be able to disrupt its control over those Broods. If we can do enough superficial damage to the creature, it might pacify the Zerg nearest to it, allowing us some time to retrieve the Khalis.
Conversation/ProtossX06/Line00005=A bold plan, young Artanis. Your courage rivals that of mighty Tassadar himself!
Conversation/ProtossX06/Line00006=You give me too much credit, noble Zeratul. I am not worthy enough to even speak his name.
Conversation/ProtossX06/Line00007=Touching. Look, boys, either of these plans will work, but let's not waste any time. I'll be able to exert limited control over a few of the Zerg here and provide you with some back-up. But the longer we stay, the more we risk losing both the crystals again.
Conversation/ProtossX06/Line00008=Agreed. Executor, deploy your forces. May Adun be with you!
Conversation/ProtossX06/Line00009=Executor, the Overmind has been rendered inert, though we've only bought ourselves a few precious minutes. We must claim the Khalis without delay!
Conversation/ProtossX06/Line00010=Executor, the Khalis is ours! Let us depart this wretched world and return to Shakuras! Provided there is still a Shakuras to return to...

Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00001=Congratulations, Executor. Your success has brought us the promise of hope against the Zerg. However, we face a new threat within our own ranks. In your absence, Judicator Aldaris and an entire legion of Khalai survivors from Aiur have begun an open revolt against us.
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00002=By the gods, this is ill news indeed! Why would Aldaris betray us so?
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00003=He and his ilk believe that it was wrong to have abandoned Aiur and consorted with our people. Their prejudices have driven them to perpetuate the Conclave's sins against us! Even now, Aldaris and his loyalist templar forces are preparing to attack our Citadel.
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00004=I can scarcely believe this. As if the Zerg were not enough! Matriarch, are you certain of this?
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00005=All too certain, young templar. Executor, as Matriarch of the Dark Templar and custodian of this world, I hereby order you to terminate Judicator Aldaris, and quell this untimely uprising without delay! There will be no dissent among us while the Zerg are poised to strike!
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00006=There is something amiss here. The Matriarch has always been a wise and gentle soul. Though there is some merit in her decision, this is very unlike her.
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00007=That may well be... But right now we have a friend to kill. May Adun forgive us.
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00008=Be advised, Executor, our forces are divided.  Aldaris has taken control of our templar warriors and Arbiters. It is possible that he may even send Archons against us.
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00009=Fear not, comrades, for we have Archons of our own! Should the dire need arise, all Dark Templar may merge to become Dark Archons. Though we sacrifice our warriors in doing so, only the might of the Dark Archons can match the forces of Aldaris.
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00010=Yet again, Executor, you destroy only a simulacrum of myself! You believe me to be a traitor, but it is you and the Matriarch who will usher our race to oblivion!
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00011=You didn't think I'd be caught so easily did you, Executor?  You have only destroyed a phantom.
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00012=It is finished, Judicator. Surrender your remaining forces, and join us in eradicating the Zerg.
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00013=I would sooner die, dark one, than tarnish the memory of Aiur by joining with you. Your fate was sealed the moment your Matriarch allied herself with the Queen of Blades! Those of us still loyal to Aiur will never be slaves to Kerrigan and her Broods.
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00014=Aldaris, be reasonable! Kerrigan has changed. She no longer seeks to enslave anyone. Do not force us to destroy you.
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00015=You can no longer afford to be so naive, Artanis. While you were securing the crystals, I discovered that your Matriarch has been harboring a dark secret! She has been manipulated by de-

Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00019=Wretched creature! This was a Protoss matter; you had no right to interfere! Begone from this world! You are no longer welcome among us!
Conversation/ProtossX07/Line00020=Fine. I've done what I came here to do. I've insured the destruction of the renegade Cerebrates, and I used you to do it.<n/>Have fun, mighty Protoss... We'll be seeing each other again, real soon...

Conversation/ProtossX08/Line00001=This entire chain of events has been masterminded by Kerrigan, and we played right into her hands!
Conversation/ProtossX08/Line00002=Yes we did, Artanis. Yet our course is set nonetheless. Using the Temple's energies against the renegade Zerg may accomplish Kerrigan's aims, but it is still our only chance of survival.
Conversation/ProtossX08/Line00003=And survive we will, my warriors. For too long have we labored in futile defense as our enemies push us further and further away from victory. The time has come to let loose the full fury of our powers! Never again shall Shakuras be despoiled by the foul touch of alien species! These Zerg shall be the first to fall before us!
Conversation/ProtossX08/Line00004=Matriarch, I have served you for many millennia. I have always valued your wisdom and strength. Yet lately, in your mind, I have sensed something that clouds your true spirit. Though Kerrigan has gone, I wonder if her treachery still remains?
Conversation/ProtossX08/Line00005=Be at ease, Zeratul. I am still the same Raszagal you have always known. These recent events have weighed heavily upon me and I am wearied. But fear not; my warrior spirit will shine before you, and light your path to victory.
Conversation/ProtossX08/Line00006=Indeed.
Conversation/ProtossX08/Line00007=The time for action is upon us! The crystals must be taken to the Temple while the Zerg still muster their forces. I shall carry the Uraj myself, while Zeratul handles the Khalis.
Conversation/ProtossX08/Line00008=Executor, you shall provide escort for Artanis and Zeratul as they make their way to the Temple. Gods willing, we will channel the energies of the Xel'Naga, and scour this world clean of the Zerg! Go now, my children, and know that the survival of our entire race depends upon your actions!
Conversation/ProtossX08/Line00009=When you bring the crystals to the Temple, the Zerg will surely send all of their legions to destroy you. You must be prepared to protect the Temple itself from the Swarm!
Conversation/ProtossX08/Line00010=The Uraj is secured!
Conversation/ProtossX08/Line00011=The Khalis is secured!
Conversation/ProtossX08/Line00012=Executor, Zeratul and I will begin to channel the Temple's energies. You must prevent the Zerg from destroying the Temple while we work! Adun be with you, Executor!
Conversation/ProtossX08/Line00013=Executor, the channeling is complete! Withdraw our forces into the Temple... and brace yourself!

Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00001=Well, Artanis, you called and I came. What's the haps?
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00002=Impetuous as ever I see. Your quick response honors me Captain Raynor. This is a time of great danger for both our people. Our old nemesis, Admiral Stukov, has returned to finish his original plans.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00003=I've heard the rumors.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00004=As you are well aware, Admiral Stukov was infested by the Zerg Cerebrate Kaloth. The Cerebrate's cells regenerated Stukov's own, bringing him back to life. Now he lords over his own secret Brood.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00005=We weren't the best of friends, but I know Stukov was an honorable man. I can't believe he'd ever sell out to the Zerg!
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00006=Come now. I know you, of all your people, are not that naïve.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00007=So, we are gonna go down and kill him, is that it?
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00008=No. In fact we have devised a way to save him. Our scouts have tracked Stukov to his base of operations on the world of Braxis. Our scientists have developed a radical Nanotech Serum, capable of neutralizing the Zerg's evolutionary virus.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00009=If you can find Stukov and inject him with the Nanites, we believe it will reverse his infestation.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00010=Hell, sounds worth a try. Will I be getting some back up from Zeratul or am I playing lone wolf?
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00011=Praetor Taldarin will accompany you. He is one of our greatest warriors and I am sure his experience will aid you greatly, as it has in the past.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00012=Great, I get to hang with the old-timer. Alright Artanis, when do we begin?
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00013=As soon as you are ready. En Taro Tassadar.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00014=So, Taldarin, I never did get to ask you. What's yer story?
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00015=A millennia ago, I fought alongside the mighty Adun. Wounded in battle, my body was kept in stasis for several hundred years.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00016=Then the Dragoon exo-skeleton was created. I was one of the first.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00017=Wait, Adun? As in 'En Taro Adun...' that guy? Damn...well in that case, old-timer, I'm glad yer along for the ride!
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00018=I am honored to fight at your side once again James Raynor, we should be on our way. Stukov should be in the northeast.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00019=Lets wax 'em!
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00020=Wait, I can help you. I can drive a tank and I know where to get one.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00021=Alright, we could use a good tank driver.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00022=It is fortunate that Stukov is not yet at his full power. These wretched creatures are not as potent as they could be.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00023=This appears to be the entrance. However, it is heavily fortified. We should seek an alternative route.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00024=En Taro Adun, Taldarin.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00025=Thank you for saving us oh mighty Taldarin.  We will fight by your side until our days have come to an end.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00026=Stukov is crazy! Get us out of this lousy outfit.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00027=Thanks for the rescue. The assault was impossible but I had to try something on my own. With you as backup I should be able to break in.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00028=Riiiiight.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00029=Is arrogance instilled at birth in all humans?
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00030=Come on, we've gotta make our play for the station.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00031=Plasma field disabled.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00032=There's Stukov, get him!
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00033=Now you will taste the vengeance of the New Swarm.  Destroy them!!!
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00034=Release me!  You know nothing of what-
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00035=Injecting...nanite cellular reconstruction initiated commander.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00036=No!  You will not wrest me from the Swarm!  I will...we will...nooo!
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00037=Take it easy Admiral.  Just let it all happen...
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00038=Raynor!  You... You poor simple child.  You will never understand what I have lost.  The clarity...gone...
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00039=Even now they begin to turn against me.  We must leave, I know a way.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00040=Alright, let's get an immediate evac!
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00041=Finally, I taste freedom.  Yet, I have become unworthy since my capture.  I should have died in battle.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00042=Yes, but you may yet make amends.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00043=Good to see you Jim, I knew you'd come through.
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00044=Still playing with fire I see...
Conversation/ResurrectionIV/Line00045=Praetor Artanis, you may purify Braxis when ready.

Conversation/Terran00t/Line00019=In order to equip additional personnel you must have enough supply depots to support them.
Conversation/Terran00t/Line00020=You can use SCV's to build additional supply depots.

Conversation/Terran01/Line00001=Adjutant Online. Good evening, Magistrate. I'll fill you in on what's been happening: Confederate traffic has increased substantially within the system due to the recent Protoss destruction of the Chau Sara colony. The Confederates have tightened security on all outlying systems, and it's likely that this colony will be locked-down as well.  An encrypted Confederate transmission came for you while you were at dinner. Replaying transmission:
Conversation/Terran01/Line00002=Greetings, Magistrate. I'm General Edmund Duke of the Confederate Security Forces, Alpha Squadron. The Confederacy has quarantined this entire planet, and we'll proceed with the lock-down within 48 hours. You're to relocate your core colonists to the outlying wastelands. Now I know there won't be any problems with these new arrangements.
Conversation/Terran01/Line00003=Transmission ended. I have contacted the local Marshal, James Raynor. Raynor has agreed to meet your personnel en route and escort them to the new wasteland site.<n/>
Conversation/Terran01/Line00004=I can't believe we're being sent to the Wasteland. These Confederates think they can push anybody around.
Conversation/Terran01/Line00005=Howdy, boys. I'm Jim Raynor, the Marshal of these parts.

Conversation/Terran02/Line00003=Priority alert! Backwater Station under attack by unknown alien organisms. Distress beacon activated at 0658. Alerting Confederate headquarters on Tarsonis... Stand by for incoming transmission.
Conversation/Terran02/Line00004=We've already received the distress beacon from Backwater, and we'll take care of it. You just sit tight. You'll be notified if there's anything we think you need to know.
Conversation/Terran02/Line00005=Damn! Listen, if we wait for Confederate reinforcements, that station's dust. I'll head out there now, do what I can. You send in some militia, and we'll save those folks. Trust me.
Conversation/Terran02/Line00006=Glad to see you, boys. Time to kick some serious butt.
Conversation/Terran02/Line00007=These things have been out here awhile. But they could be pretty useful.

Conversation/Terran02/Line00009=Thanks for the rescue. We've been holed up in these bunkers for days hiding from the Zerg!
Conversation/Terran02/Line00010=What the hell is that? Looks like the ground there is alive.
Conversation/Terran02/Line00011=What the hell did they do to that Command Center?
Conversation/Terran02/Line00012=Whatever it is, it ain't natural. Burn it, boys.
Conversation/Terran02/Line00013=What the hell did they do to that Command Center?
Conversation/Terran02/Line00014=Receiving incoming transmission...
Conversation/Terran02/Line00015=Marshal Raynor, by destroying a vital Confederate installation, you and your men have violated standing colonial law. As of right now, you're all under arrest. I suggest you throw down your weapons and come peaceably.
Conversation/Terran02/Line00016=Are you outta your mind!? If we hadn't burned that damn factory, this entire colony could have been overrun! Maybe if you hadn't taken your sweet time in getting here -
Conversation/Terran02/Line00017=Now I asked you nice the first time, boy. I didn't come here to talk with you. Now throw down them weapons!

Conversation/Terran03/Line00003=Transmission ended. The report you requested is ready. Sixteen outland stations have reported sightings of the alien invaders identified as Zerg. The Confederates have arrested all standing militia forces and continue to avoid action against the Zerg. Three stations have fallen to the Zerg already. We've been unable to locate any source of military relief except... the extremist faction known as the Sons of Korhal. Their liaison is holding on line.
Conversation/Terran03/Line00004=Good day, Magistrate. My name is Arcturus Mengsk, and I represent the Sons of Korhal. You're familiar with the Confederate propaganda surrounding my group, but your reputation suggests you'll see past it. It's never been our practice to operate in any one place for long, but these Zerg don't look like they're going to wait. I'm going to make you an offer, Magistrate. I'd like to help you out by sending down a number of transports to your colony and evacuating any survivors.
Conversation/Terran03/Line00005=You know, of course, that my organization operates outside the bounds of Confederate law. That's why they spread their lies and misinformation. If you decide to accept our help, you'll be branded as an outlaw too. But, it's a chance to save those people. Time to make a stand, Magistrate.
Conversation/Terran03/Line00006=Ending transmission. Priority alert! Evacuation zone under attack by Zerg forces. Distress beacon activated at 1220.
Conversation/Terran03/Line00007=Hey, this thing's on fire! You oughta' send an SCV out here and repair it, and fix my bike up too while he's at it.

Conversation/Terran04/Line00003=Commander, Mar Sara is almost completely overrun by the Zerg. The Confederates are abandoning the planet, and so are we. However, there is one thing I'd like to do before we leave.
Conversation/Terran04/Line00004=I want you to raid this colony's  Confederate outpost and retrieve whatever design or weapons' schematics that you can find in their networks. With the chaos of the Confederates' evacuation, you shouldn't have any trouble getting in or out of their installation.
Conversation/Terran04/Line00005=I'm into it.
Conversation/Terran04/Line00006=Zerg! I don't believe this!
Conversation/Terran04/Line00007=Believe it. I saw Zerg within Confederate holding pens myself, and that was over a year ago. It's clear the Confederates have known of these creatures for some time. For all we know they could be breeding the things! Be that as it may, our priority here is accessing the Confederate network. We'll deal with the Zerg another day.
Conversation/Terran04/Line00008=You rebel scum!

Conversation/Terran05/Line00002=Receiving incoming transmission from Arcturus Mengsk:
Conversation/Terran05/Line00003=You and Captain Raynor have done well, Commander. I believe our efforts have weakened the Confederacy's grip on the fringe worlds, but our job out here isn't done yet. Lieutenant Kerrigan, my second in command, will elaborate.
Conversation/Terran05/Line00004=I'll get straight to the point. Our sources tell us that Antiga Prime is ready to begin open revolt against the Confederacy. Unfortunately, the Confederates seem to be aware of this as well. They've stationed a large detachment of Alpha Squadron troops there, under the command of General Duke.
Conversation/Terran05/Line00005=It will be your job, Commander, to free this colony and show our good intent to the Antigan people. Lieutenant Kerrigan will help you deal with Duke's officers. The rest of the Confederates are yours to deal with.
Conversation/Terran05/Line00006=Captain Raynor, I've finished scouting out the area, and-you pig!
Conversation/Terran05/Line00007=What? I haven't even said anything to you yet!
Conversation/Terran05/Line00008=Yeah, but you were thinking it.
Conversation/Terran05/Line00009=Oh yeah, you're a telepath. Look, let's just get on with this, okay?
Conversation/Terran05/Line00010=Right.
Conversation/Terran05/Line00011=I hate these things. They can sense me even when I'm cloaked. We should take these out.
Conversation/Terran05/Line00012=I've taken care of business on this end, Commander. I think the Antigans are ready to back us up, too.
Conversation/Terran05/Line00013=That's right. We've tolerated these Confederate goons long enough!
Conversation/Terran05/Line00014=Commander, I'm picking up a large Confederate strike force advancing on our position.

Conversation/Terran06/Line00001=It appears that the Confederates are in a state of panic about the Antigan revolt. I'm picking up a high number of Confederate transmissions going back and forth between their outposts and their headquarters on Tarsonis. Most of the transmissions are heavily coded, but wait, here's something:
Conversation/Terran06/Line00002=This is General Duke calling from Alpha Squadron Flagship Norad II! We've crash-landed and are being hit hard by the Zerg! Request immediate backup from anyone receiving this signal! Repeat, this is a priority one distress call-
Conversation/Terran06/Line00003=Zerg? Here? Serves 'em right. 'Bout time they got a taste of what it's like to be in there mixin' it up.
Conversation/Terran06/Line00004=Jim, I want you to move in and save that base.
Conversation/Terran06/Line00005=I'm positive I didn't hear that right.
Conversation/Terran06/Line00006=Arcturus, have you lost your mind?
Conversation/Terran06/Line00007=Listen, I know Duke's a cold hearted bastard, but an entire colony shouldn't have to suffer for that. Besides, a Confederate general could prove to be a powerful ally. This is an opportunity we cannot miss.
Conversation/Terran06/Line00008=I don't like this at all.
Conversation/Terran06/Line00009=I'm not asking you to like it. I'm asking you to do it.
Conversation/Terran06/Line00010=Yes, sir.
Conversation/Terran06/Line00011=Great. Let's get this over with.

Conversation/Terran06/Line00014=Our angle? I'll give you an angle, you slimy Confederate piece of sh--
Conversation/Terran06/Line00015=Jim, enough! I'll handle this. The Confederacy is falling apart, Duke. Its colonies are in open revolt. The Zerg are rampaging unchecked. What would have happened here today if we hadn't shown up?
Conversation/Terran06/Line00016=Your point?
Conversation/Terran06/Line00017=I'm giving you a choice. You can return to the Confederacy and lose, or you can join us and help save our entire race from being overrun by the Zerg. I don't think it's a difficult decision.
Conversation/Terran06/Line00018=Join forces? With you? I'm a general, for God's sake!
Conversation/Terran06/Line00019=A general without an army. I'm offering you a position in my cabinet, not just some backwater post. Don't test my patience, Edmund.
Conversation/Terran06/Line00020=All right, Mengsk. You've got a deal.
Conversation/Terran06/Line00021=You've made the right choice, General Duke.

Conversation/Terran07/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/Terran07/Group00002=Intro
Conversation/Terran07/Group00003=Psi Emitter in Place
Conversation/Terran07/Line00001=Commander, our position has been discovered. As of two hours ago, a large Confederate strike force arrived on Antiga Prime and established a base camp within our defensive perimeter. Arcturus Mengsk is calling a meeting.
Conversation/Terran07/Line00002=Greetings. I know you're all concerned about the Confederate strike force, but first we have a grave matter to discuss. It seems our data discs didn't hold weapon designs after all. Lieutenant Kerrigan will explain.
Conversation/Terran07/Line00003=You all know that the Confederates run a program for psychically gifted humans, training them to be Ghosts. Those running the program found that the Zerg are attuned to the psychic emanations of Ghosts.
Conversation/Terran07/Line00004=So the Zerg are here for you, darlin'? This keeps gettin' better and better.
Conversation/Terran07/Line00005=Shut up. There's been a lot of secret Confederate research surrounding Ghosts and the Zerg. What we stole was a small but critical piece of the puzzle: designs for a Transplanar Psionic Waveform Emitter. The emitters broadcast the neural imprint of a Ghost, but at a much greater magnitude. These things reach across worlds.
Conversation/Terran07/Line00006=The Confederacy used these Psi Emitters to lure the Zerg into isolated containment areas. Your colony-Mar Sara-Commander, was one such location.
Conversation/Terran07/Line00007=What are you saying?
Conversation/Terran07/Line00008=I'm saying the Zerg are a secret weapon developed by the Confederacy. I'm saying you were all subjects of a Confederate weapons test.
Conversation/Terran07/Line00009=Just as they destroyed Korhal with nuclear weapons to establish dominance a generation ago, they would use the Zerg to put an end to their other rivals. Only this time there'd be no outrage; who could suspect the aliens were their creation? No, they'd be lauded as heroes for coming in and destroying the Zerg. It's time the Confederacy paid for its crimes.
Conversation/Terran07/Line00010=And I know just the way. Lieutenant Kerrigan is going to plant an emitter at the Confederate base camp. Commander, you will provide her with an escort. When the Zerg arrive, they'll break the blockade for us and we'll make our escape. Now, get moving.
Conversation/Terran07/Line00011=I'm having doubts about this, Arcturus. I just don't think anyone deserves to have the Zerg unleashed on them.
Conversation/Terran07/Line00012=I know you have personal feelings about this, but you can't let your past cloud your judgment. Carry out your orders, lieutenant.
Conversation/Terran07/Line00013=Yes, sir.
Conversation/Terran07/Line00014=Psi-Emitter in place. Just promise me we'll never do anything like this again.

Conversation/Terran07s/Line00002=This defensive crap just isn't working! This is just like Mar Sara, man... Look, it's risky, but I think we can save the Colonists and still buy time to get off-world. If we attack the main Zerg Hive Cluster, they'll have to recall their forces to protect the nerve center.
Conversation/Terran07s/Line00003=That'll never work. Where'd you study tactics, boy? You'd be outnumbered at least twenty to one.
Conversation/Terran07s/Line00004=You damn coward! What, does the prospect of saving innocent civilians instead of wiping 'em out churn your stomach?

Conversation/Terran08/Line00001=Greetings, Commander. Receiving incoming transmission:
Conversation/Terran08/Line00002=The time of our final strike against the Confederacy is close at hand. Before we can strike at Tarsonis itself, however, we must break through the Confederacy's most potent defenses. General Duke will brief you.
Conversation/Terran08/Line00003=I've defended Tarsonis in over thirty major battles, so I know its defenses inside and out. There are three primary orbital platforms that serve as staging areas for the Confederate fleet. If we assault the central platform, we should cause enough of a ruckus to allow a small force to break through the planetary defenses.
Conversation/Terran08/Line00004=General, I'm impressed. I never figured you for the frontal assault type.
Conversation/Terran08/Line00005=Well, the Confederates have Omega and Delta Squadron troops defending the platform. They're nothing compared to my Alpha Squadron boys.
Conversation/Terran08/Line00006=Right.
Conversation/Terran08/Line00007=I can't believe this! Alpha Squadron never would've left this equipment behind! That's what I call sloppy!

Conversation/Terran08/Line00010=I did, lieutenant.
Conversation/Terran08/Line00011=What? The Confederates on Antiga were bad enough, but now you're going to use the Zerg against an entire planet? This is insane.

Conversation/Terran08s/Line00004=Arcturus, that's not what we discussed! Even if we can capture it, how will we ever hold that area?

Conversation/Terran09/Line00002=If they engage the Zerg, the Confederates may escape. Commander, send Lieutenant Kerrigan with a strike force to engage the Protoss. Captain Raynor and General Duke will stay behind with the command ship.
Conversation/Terran09/Line00003=First you sell out every person on this world to the Zerg, then you ask us to go up against the Protoss? And you're goin' to send Kerrigan down there with no backup?
Conversation/Terran09/Line00004=I have absolute confidence in Kerrigan's ability to hold off the Protoss.
Conversation/Terran09/Line00005=This is bullshit. Kerrigan, are you reading this?
Conversation/Terran09/Line00006=I heard. I'm going down there. Arcturus knows what he's doing. I can't back out on him now.
Conversation/Terran09/Line00007=Funny. I never thought of you as anyone's martyr.
Conversation/Terran09/Line00008=Why are you doing this, Kerrigan? Look. I know about your past. I mean, I've heard the rumors. I know you were a part of those experiments with the Zerg; that Mengsk came and saved you, but you don't owe him this! Hell, I've saved your butt plenty of times.
Conversation/Terran09/Line00009=Jimmy, drop the knight-in-shining-armor routine. It suits you sometimes. Just not ... not now. I don't need to be rescued. I know what I'm doing. The Protoss are coming to destroy the entire planet, not just the Zerg. I know that because ... well I just know it. I am a Ghost, remember? Once we've dealt with the Protoss, we can do something about the Zerg. Arcturus will come around. I know he will.

Conversation/TerranX01/Line00011=Well, I possess intimate knowledge of the surrounding area. I can show you an alternate route that leads to the rear of the main Dominion base.
Conversation/TerranX01/Line00012=Very well, Lieutenant. Consider yourself and your men the first colonial conscripts of the United Earth Directorate. Captain, see that the Lieutenant is given our full cooperation. We shall see if he's worth the effort.
Conversation/TerranX01/Line00013=Mission succesful, Admiral.
Conversation/TerranX01/Line00014=Excellent, Lieutenant. This planet's primary defenses are now crippled. Our Tac Teams can now begin to decode the Dominion's security datalink.

Conversation/TerranX02/Line00001=Receiving incoming transmission.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00002=Captain, Vice Admiral Stukov has informed me of your flawless sortie upon Braxis. I must commend you for beginning our campaign with such a decisive victory. Our Tac Teams have decrypted the Dominion's datalink and have gained access to Mengsk's most guarded files. However, our work is not yet complete.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00003=We have ascertained the location of the Dylarian shipyards. These shipyards, serving as a fueling and repair station for the Dominion, house a number of functional Battlecruisers in dry-dock. To assure that our domination of this sector remains uncontested, you are to assault the shipyards and liberate as many of these capital ships as possible.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00004=Gentlemen, I recommend that you launch this attack using the utmost caution. Dominion Command can typically reinforce its outlying bases within sixteen standard hours. You should expect some sort of reprisal from Emperor Mengsk shortly.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00005=Ah, the turncoat. I suggest that you pay keen attention to rank when you address the Captain and myself, Lieutenant Duran. Is that understood?
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00006=Of course, Admiral.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00007=Heh heh. You're beginning to show your age, Gerard. Give the boy some credit. He just tipped us off to a preeminent attack.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00008=However useful he may prove to be, Alexei, he will always be a traitor in my eyes. And you know that I cannot abide a traitor.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00009=Only too well, Gerard. Captain, when you are ready, you may commence with the operation. Once you have commandeered the enemy's battlecruisers, be prepared to repel the Dominion reinforcements when they arrive.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00010=Once your forces have landed, Captain, you'll need to escort our pilots to the battlecruisers themselves. They will be able to commandeer the ships and turn them over to our control.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00011=All right, troops, listen up! Each squad will have a Medic assigned to it to patch up the wounded. But that doesn't mean you can get careless! Stay frosty and get the job done!
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00012=I'm sending you a few backup pilots. Our pilots are a valued resource, Captain. Watch over them carefully.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00013=Additional pilots are en route now to your location, Captain. Try not to be so careless with them in the future.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00014=Sir, permission to blind that tank with an Optical Flare.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00015=Sir, the nuke silos are secured. We've got four nukes on standby, awaiting your orders.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00016=Heads up, we got company!
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00017=We gotta shake this lockdown pronto! Medic! Restore us!
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00018=Captain, we are tracking a large fleet of Dominion ships in your vicinity.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00019=Ah, these must be the reinforcements that Lieutenant Duran warned us about. Captain, prepare our newly acquired fleet to battle the intruders.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00020=Captain, we are being hailed by the Dominion flagship, Norad III.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00021=Well, now. I don't know which militia you all are from, but I advise ya' to back down... NOW! I'm General Edmund Duke of the Dominion armada. And in the name of Emperor Mengsk, I order you to surrender your forces immediately and unconditionally.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00022=Ah, General Duke. I expected your forces to arrive sooner. You should know that we represent not one of your rag-tag peasant Militias, but the combined might of the United Earth Directorate.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00023=Earth Directorate? You mean to tell me you've come all the way out here from Earth?
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00024=That is correct, General. We're here to take control over this sector and its occupants for the betterment of mankind.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00025=Over my dead body. I don't care where yer' from, son. No one pushes around the Terran Dominion on my watch! All units, fire at will!
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00026=Battlecruiser operational.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00027=Your careless tactics are costing us valuable time and resources, Captain. Several reserve pilots are on the way to help you finish the job, and I expect results.
Conversation/TerranX02/Line00028=Captain, if you cannot protect your pilots, I will find someone who can. I am sending one last flight crew to your position. Finish your mission; we will discuss your tactics when you return.
Conversation/TerranX03/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/TerranX03/Group00002=Start
Conversation/TerranX03/Group00003=Victory
Conversation/TerranX03/Group00004=Just as I thought
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00001=Captain, the Dominion shipyards have been destroyed, and it seems that General Duke has withdrawn his forces from this quadrant. We have impressed most of the remaining Dylarian defense forces into the fleet and stand ready to move to the next phase of our invasion.
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00002=We've just received word from our research team that they've uncovered some kind of hidden weapons relay upon the planet Tarsonis. They report that it's called a Psi Disrupter, and that its purpose is somehow connected with the Zerg.
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00003=Admiral, during the Zerg invasion of these colonies, the Confederacy had manufactured a number of portable machines called Psi Emitters which had the uncanny ability to lure Zerg to their signals. It was rumored that they had created a specialized emitter that could disrupt the Zerg's communications, but Emperor Mengsk was never able to find it.<n/><n/>It appears that this Psi Disrupter is the machine he was looking for. I must humbly suggest to you, Admiral, that the Disrupter be destroyed as quickly as possible. If it should fall into the hands of the Dominion we could face some very serious problems.
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00004=Hmm. A prudent call, Lieutenant. I am inclined to agree.
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00005=But Admiral, this device could insure our victory over the Zerg! It is foolhardy to discard such an advantage!
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00006=Surely, Vice Admiral, you don't doubt the tenacity of your own fleet? Your Directorate forces will devastate the Zerg without the need for such a device.
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00007=Listen here, Lieutenant, I've had just about enough of your-
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00008=This conversation is over, Alexei. Given the true nature of our mission to enslave the Overmind, we could hardly stand to have Mengsk control a device of this magnitude. This Psi Disrupter must be destroyed in order to safeguard our mission. Ensign, set your course for Tarsonis.
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00009=Captain, our sensors are tracking Zerg signals in every direction. It appears that our intelligence was correct.
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00010=Admiral, If we focus on destroying all of the hives in this area, we may be able to neutralize these Zerg without too much trouble.
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00011=Go ahead, HQ.
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00012=Lieutenant Duran, since you have shown such concern for this device's inherent danger, I charge you with finding the Disrupter and securing it. We will commence with its destruction once we've cleared the area.
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00013=Just as I thought. This brood can't operate without its primary Hive cluster.
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00014=Captain, we've located the Psi Disrupter. Shall we plant the explosives on it?
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00015=Lieutenant Duran, we're here to relieve you. We've come with orders from Admiral Stukov himself to facilitate the Disrupter's disassembly.
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00016=Very well. Take it away. Captain, I'll be returning to the command ship presently.
Conversation/TerranX03/Line00017=It's worth a try. Captain, you will provide the Lieutenant with whatever aid he may require. We are sending the main fleet on ahead to Augustgrad, so you will not have any battlecruisers available to you. Good luck!
Conversation/TerranX04/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/TerranX04/Group00002=Victory
Conversation/TerranX04/Line00001=Captain, once again your leadership has set a fine example to the rest of my officers. Vice Admiral Stukov has informed me that the Psi Disrupter has been accounted for, so we can now proceed with the next phase of our operation. The time has come to begin our primary invasion of the Dominion throne world of Korhal. Alexei, fill the Captain in on the current situation.
Conversation/TerranX04/Line00002=As you may know from your research, Captain, Korhal was a hotbed of anti-Confederate sentiment for years. The Confederacy hoped to contain Korhal's civil unrest by decimating it and its population with a massive nuclear barrage. Though the radiation levels on the planet are at an all time low, its surface is now nothing more than a smoldering desert.
Conversation/TerranX04/Line00003=The catch, Admiral, is that because this world has already been devastated by nuclear fire, Mengsk has no compunction against using Nukes on us. We have detected a large cluster of missile silos on the outskirts of Augustgrad. If those silos were destroyed, we believe that Mengsk would lose his core nuclear capabilities.
Conversation/TerranX04/Line00004=We also face a different obstacle, Captain. Intelligence has informed us that Mengsk employs multiple battlecruisers for his planetary defense. It is possible to nullify these battlecruisers by taking out strategic physics labs. Without these labs, Mengsk will be unable to power-up his ships' weapons systems.
Conversation/TerranX04/Line00005=Though we know how to compensate for Mengsk's defenses, we don't have enough time to follow through on them both. Therefore, Captain, you must choose to either counter his nuclear capabilities or his battlecruisers. Once you've taken care of this operation, we can begin to plan our final assault against Augustgrad.
Conversation/TerranX04/Line00006=Superbly done, Captain. Mengsk's battlecruisers are now effectively powerless. He won't be able to use them against us when we assault his palace.
Conversation/TerranX04/Line00007=Well done, Captain. We won't need to worry about nukes when we siege Mengsk's palace.

Conversation/TerranX05/Group00003=Run for it!
Conversation/TerranX05/Group00004=Victory
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00001=Captain, Admiral DuGalle has ordered a final tactical meeting before the siege of Augustgrad commences. I'll patch you through to his war room.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00002=Ah, Captain, we've been expecting you. As you may have guessed, we are coordinating our final attack plans. You should know, that even though Mengsk cannot reinforce his numbers, his standing forces are substantial. Augustgrad is easily the most heavily fortified city in all of Dominion space. And remember that Mengsk is an accomplished tactician so you had best be wary of any counter attacks he may attempt.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00003=Also, despite the fact that we have crippled his fleet of battlecruisers, we suspect that Mengsk will unload his nuclear silos whenever the opportunity presents itself. Keep security tight at all of your bases, and watch out for enemy Ghosts.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00004=And, Captain, remember that although we disabled Mengsk's nuclear capabilities, he still commands a large number of Battlecruisers. We suspect that he will use these ships against us at every turn. Be on your guard, Captain. Show this 'Emperor' what the UED thinks of his rule.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00005=That should cover it, Captain. Be careful and good luck. By the day's end, the Terran Dominion will be nothing more than a bad memory.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00006=Reinforcements already in transit. Just sit tight.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00007=Abandoning auxiliary structure.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00008=Captain, I'm tracking the Dominion flagship, Norad III, in low orbit. Emperor Mengsk may be attempting an escape. Receiving incoming transmission.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00009=This is Emperor Mengsk of the Terran Dominion. I wish to parlay with your Executive Officer at once!
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00010=So, the elusive Arcturus Mengsk at last. I was hoping to speak with you before we finished our business here. I am Admiral Gerard DuGalle, and I must commend you, Sir, for holding back our advance for as long as you have. You are indeed a worthy opponent.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00011=My thanks to you, Sir. But you must know that your victory here means little to me. It might have taken me awhile, but I did overthrow the Confederacy. I'll overthrow your rule as well.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00012=That seems unlikely, Sir, seeing as how you'll be publicly executed along with the rest of your ranking officers.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00013=You wouldn't dare!
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00014=Hah! The man who crowns himself 'Emperor' speaks to me of daring? You have far outlived your reputation, citizen Mengsk. Captain, prepare to take the Emperor into custody.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00015=You'll have to postpone those plans, gentlemen.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00016=Sir, the rebel command ship, Hyperion, has just entered our sensor range. It is accompanied by a small Protoss fleet.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00017=What? Who are these intruders!
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00018=Jim Raynor... What the hell are you doing here?!
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00019=I'm pullin' your ass outta the fire, Arcturus. So shut up and sit tight. Make no mistake about it; we've got us a serious score to settle, but right now a mutual acquaintance of ours wants you alive. Prepare your ships for dimensional recall.
Conversation/TerranX05/Line00020=This is intolerable! They're escaping right out from under us! Track them! Track them!
Conversation/TerranX06/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/TerranX06/Group00002=intro
Conversation/TerranX06/Group00003=Victory
Conversation/TerranX06/Line00001=Captain, we have tracked the fugitives Mengsk and Raynor to the devastated Protoss homeworld of Aiur. Apparently, these two have taken shelter within a fortified Protoss encampment that lies at the base of a fully functional warp gate...
Conversation/TerranX06/Line00002=I don't understand this. Why would the Protoss harbor these men?
Conversation/TerranX06/Line00003=I have no idea, Gerard, but the Protoss aren't our only problem. Our sensors have identified multiple Zerg broods surrounding the Protoss base. Presently, the broods seem to be passive, but there's no telling what might set them off.  Should the broods attack, we'd be hard pressed to hold them at bay.
Conversation/TerranX06/Line00004=I see. It is a risk we'll need to take. Mengsk represents a considerable threat to our agenda and must be eliminated. Captain, you will focus your attack against the rebel command center in the middle of the Protoss encampment.  That must be where Mengsk and Raynor are hiding. We will deploy our own Valkyrie frigates and tighten up our air defenses. Vice Admiral Stukov and Lieutenant Duran will provide cover for your forces, and insure that no external threats interfere with your mission.
Conversation/TerranX06/Line00005=Captain, the warp gate at the center of the Protoss encampment has been activated! Our sensors show that the gate's energies are inciting the Zerg to attack. Be prepared for anything, Captain.
Conversation/TerranX06/Line00006=Good work, Captain. The command center is destroyed, but it looks like Mengsk and Raynor will try to escape through the warp gate. Make ready to move in and intercept their vessel before...<n/><n/>Wait, I've just picked up multiple Zerg signals coming in from the northeast. That's Duran's position, but he seems to have moved his forces out of place! Lieutenant Duran, this is Stukov! Come in! I'm tracking a massive Zerg swarm in your quadrant! Respond, damnit!
Conversation/TerranX06/Line00007=That is strange, Vice Admiral. My scanners don't show any Zerg at all. Maybe you have a technical problem with your equipment?
Conversation/TerranX06/Line00008=Lieutenant, if these Zerg get through, we'll never be able to capture Mengsk! I'm giving you a direct order to return to your position and reinforce my troops!
Conversation/TerranX06/Line00009=Oh, I'm sorry sir, but it seems your signal's... fading out. I couldn't... make out that last part. I'll try to... re-establish contact later.
Conversation/TerranX06/Line00010=Duran! Captain, your position will be overrun by superior Zerg numbers within fifteen minutes. I suggest you retreat back to the fleet immediately. Inform Admiral DuGalle that I have a personal matter to take care of...

Conversation/TerranX07/Group00025======
Conversation/TerranX07/Line00001=Admiral, the fugitives Mengsk and Raynor escaped through the warp gate due to the intervention of the Zerg. But shortly before our forces were overrun, Vice Admiral Stukov took control of a large contingent of troops and came here to the planet Braxis.
Conversation/TerranX07/Line00002=Why would he abandon the battle on Aiur? <n/><n/>Why has he come back to Braxis?
Conversation/TerranX07/Line00003=I mean no offense, Admiral. But perhaps Stukov's loyalties are not as strong as you once believed.
Conversation/TerranX07/Line00004=Because you are young and foolish, Lieutenant, I will pardon that insult. Alexei and I have been friends since long before you were born. However, he must be found. If Stukov is here, he will account for his actions.
Conversation/TerranX07/Line00005=Admiral, our sensors have detected a fully functional Psi Disrupter on the planet's surface directly below our position. It would appear that the Vice Admiral did not destroy the Psi Disrupter on Tarsonis as was ordered.
Conversation/TerranX07/Line00006=What? Impossible!
Conversation/TerranX07/Line00007=I warned you, Admiral! Stukov has betrayed you! He's reconstructed the Psi Disrupter in order to sabotage your mission in this sector!
Conversation/TerranX07/Line00008=I can't believe it. Yet the evidence is incontrovertible. Alexei, what have you done?<n/><n/>Perhaps you've been right all along, Lieutenant. On my authority, enter the Psi Disrupter... and... deal with the Vice Admiral appropriately...
Conversation/TerranX07/Line00009=Of course, Admiral.

Conversation/TerranX07/Line00048=To hell with y--
Conversation/TerranX07/Line00049=Lieutenant Duran, report your situation immediately.
Conversation/TerranX07/Line00050=Gerard... old friend. You do indeed have a traitor in your midst. But it's not me. Duran. He has been playing us both from the start... he convinced you to destroy the Psi Disrupter, even though it was our best chance at defeating the Zerg. And then, on Aiur... he allowed the Zerg to overrun us even as we had the fugitives in our grasp. I came here to activate the one hope we have of defeating them... And you killed me for it. Heh, heh... Duran is your enemy, Gerard. I suspect that he may even be infested as well... Use the Disrupter, Gerard... Finish our operation... Let my death have at least some meaning.
Conversation/TerranX07/Line00051=Alexei! No! What have I done? What have I done? Computer, where the hell is Lieutenant Duran?
Conversation/TerranX07/Line00052=The Lieutenant no longer registers on my sensors, Admiral. He appears to have vanished.

Conversation/TerranX08/Group00006=Victory
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00001=Captain, with the Psi Disrupter's signal hampering the Zergs' communications to one another, the Swarms over Char have scattered in disarray, allowing the fleet to penetrate to the planet's surface. However, there is still a considerable number of defenders nestled around the fledgling Overmind.
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00002=Alexei was right. The Disrupter is the key to victory here. If I had destroyed the machine as Duran suggested we would never have made it this far... Nevertheless, the time is upon us, Captain, to do what we came here for. We will claim the Overmind in the name of Humanity!
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00003=Be advised, Captain: our sensors have identified three cerebrates who constitute the core of the Overmind's defenses. Each cerebrate's distinct capabilities are still unknown, so proceed with extreme caution.
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00004=Launch your forces and let not a Zerg survive! Once you have reached the Overmind and crushed its defenders, you are to send in specially trained medics who will pacify the creature with potent Neurostim drugs. Only then will our victory be assured.<n/><n/>And Captain, remember that Duran is still out there somewhere. I'd venture a guess that his treachery has only just begun. Be careful and good luck. I am sure that this will be our finest hour.
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00005=Sir, these Sunken Colonies aren't being affected by anything we hit 'em with. I'll bet there's one of those Cerebrate critters pumpin' 'em full of energy nearby.
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00006=Sir, this Cerebrate's been whacked! We shouldn't have any more trouble with those Sunken Colonies!
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00007=Sir, we've eighty-sixed this Cerebrate! We shouldn't run up against any smacked-up Ultralisks anytime soon!
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00008=Sir, we've just had a whole cargo ship full of whoop-ass dumped on us! We ran into a new strain of Ultralisk and it took a lot o' pepper to bring it down. To top it all off, our recon squad reports that the critter's been reincarnated by a nearby Cerebrate, and is on its way back for more!
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00009=Captain, we've reached the perimeter of the Overmind's nesting area. We can launch the Med Team at any time, Sir.
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00010=Captain, the medics are in place and are administering the NeuroStim treatments to the Overmind.
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00011=Uh, excuse me, Admiral... but I'd like to introduce someone to you.
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00012=Duran? You sonofa bitch, what's the meaning of this!
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00013=Admiral DuGalle. I've heard a lot about you.
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00014=Who-- what the hell are you?
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00015=I am Kerrigan. The Zerg you've killed here and the Overmind that you've come to collect... are mine. As is our mutual friend, Lieutenant Duran. You see, Admiral... there are a number of groups in this sector who feel that your involvement here causes certain... complications. My associates and I intend to make sure that your reign is short lived.
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00016=You may find that difficult, you abomination, seeing as I possess the means to disrupt your control of the Zerg.
Conversation/TerranX08/Line00017=Ah, you're referring to your vaunted Psi Disrupter. It won't last you forever, Admiral. Sooner or later, I'll destroy it. Then I'll show you what the Zerg are really capable of.<n/><n/>Oh, and by the way, Admiral, your friend Stukov was twice the man you are. I'm glad you saved me the trouble of having to kill him...

Conversation/Zerg01/Line00002=Behold that I shall set you amongst the greatest of my Cerebrates, that you might benefit from their wisdom and experience. Yet your purpose is unique. While they carry forth my will to the innumerable Broods, you have but one charge entrusted to your care.
Conversation/Zerg01/Line00003=For I have found a creature that may yet become the greatest of my agents. Even now it resides within a protective Chrysalis, awaiting its rebirth into the Swarm.
Conversation/Zerg01/Line00004=You must watch over the Chrysalis, and ensure that no harm comes to the creature within it. Go now and keep safe my prize.
Conversation/Zerg01/Line00005=The Hatchery is the heart of any Zerg colony.  It spontaneously generates larva, which in turn are used to spawn your various warriors and minions.
Conversation/Zerg01/Line00006=Now, create a Drone and start gathering resources.
Conversation/Zerg01/Line00007=Overlords provide control for your minions. As your forces grow in number, you must hatch more Overlords to control them.
Conversation/Zerg01/Line00008=You have enough minerals. Select a larva and mutate it into an Overlord.
Conversation/Zerg01/Line00009=To create new warrior strains, you must generate the various hive structures.
Conversation/Zerg01/Line00010=The Drones themselves mutate into these structures. Yet be careful: Never use your last Drone to make a building.
Conversation/Zerg01/Line00011=Now, order your Drone to become a Spawning Pool.
Conversation/Zerg01/Line00012=You'll notice that structures can only implant themselves upon the creep.
Conversation/Zerg01/Line00013=You can make Creep Colonies to extend the creep, but only a Hatchery can be built upon open ground.
Conversation/Zerg01/Line00014=Greetings, I am Zasz. I too am a Cerebrate of the Overmind. I have located a small band of Terrans who could threaten the Chrysalis and the Hive Cluster. You must not allow them to leave here alive.

Conversation/Zerg02/Line00002=Now you have grown strong enough to bear the rigors of warp travel with the Swarm. Thus we shall make our exit from this blasted world and secure the Chrysalis within the Hive cluster, upon the planet Char.

Conversation/Zerg03/Line00003=All right. All squadrons close formation and scan for hostiles. Emperor Arcturus believes that there's Zerg out here, so it's our job to flush 'em out! I don't want any slip-ups this time! We'll show these critters that they can't run from the Terran Dominion!

Conversation/Zerg04/Line00002=These too shall be eradicated by your hand, Cerebrate, for you grow more cunning with each passing battle. Indeed, you are a testament to my will and the fury of the Swarm.
Conversation/Zerg04/Line00003=Yet first must you stay your wrath, and watch over the Chrysalis a while longer. For the very hour of the sleeper's rebirth is at hand, and soon my greatest creation shall be loosed.
Conversation/Zerg04/Line00004=Alright. All crews, stay frosty and keep your eyes peeled for our target. Remember, not only are we up against the Zerg here, but our old pal General Duke may be creeping around too. Let's hope this trip wasn't a big mistake...

Conversation/Zerg04/Line00011=To an extent... I'm far more than I once was, Jim. You shouldn't have come here.
Conversation/Zerg04/Line00012=But the dreams... I dreamed you were still alive... that somehow... you were calling to me.
Conversation/Zerg04/Line00013=I was. While I was in the Chrysalis, I instinctively reached out to you and Arcturus telepathically. Apparently, Arcturus sent Duke here to reclaim me. But that was then, Jim. I'm one of the Zerg, now. And I like what I am. You can't imagine how this feels...
Conversation/Zerg04/Line00014=So... what? Are you goin' to kill me now, darlin'?
Conversation/Zerg04/Line00015=It is certainly within my power. But you're not a threat to me, Jim. Be smart. Leave here now, and never seek to confront the Zerg again.

Conversation/Zerg05/Line00002=I have been unable to access the totality of my latent powers, and as such, I would like to infiltrate a Terran science vessel and uncover the secrets of their abandoned Ghost projects. If I can learn more about their mental conditioning, I can undo the damage their tinkering scientists have done to my mind.
Conversation/Zerg05/Line00003=Though you be the favored servant of the Overmind, you would do well to remember that you are just a servant. You know of our grand mission, Kerrigan. Would you put your personal whims before the will of the Overmind?

Conversation/Zerg05/Line00005=Let her go, Zasz. The greatness of her spirit has been left to her; that the Swarms might benefit from her fierce example. Fear not her designs, for she is bound to me as intimately as any Cerebrate. Truly, no Zerg can stray from my will, for all that you are lies wholly within me. Kerrigan is free to do as she desires.

Conversation/Zerg06/Line00002=Protoss commander, it was folly of you to come here. For I am Kerrigan, and I am Queen of the Zerg!
Conversation/Zerg06/Line00003=I know of you well, O Queen of the Zerg, for we have met before. I am Tassadar, of the Templar. I remember your selfless exploits, defending humanity from the Zerg. Unfortunate it is, to see that one who was once so honorable and full of life would succumb to the twisted wiles of the Overmind.
Conversation/Zerg06/Line00004=Do not presume to judge me, Templar. You'll find my powers to be more than a match for yours. In fact, I sense that your vaunted power has diminished since last we met.
Conversation/Zerg06/Line00005=Mayhap, O Queen. Or is it only that I need not flaunt my power in such an infantile test of will?
Conversation/Zerg06/Line00006=Foolish Templar. Prepare your defenses! I will come for you soon.
Conversation/Zerg06/Line00007=Kerrigan, I sense something strange about this Templar. Perhaps you should reconsider your attack.
Conversation/Zerg06/Line00008=For the last time, Zasz, you question my motives and authority at your own peril.
Conversation/Zerg06/Line00009=You dare threaten a Cerebrate? You'll be the doom of us all!
Conversation/Zerg06/Line00010=Where are you, Tassadar? Do your underlings always do your fighting for you?
Conversation/Zerg06/Line00011=This shall be our battleground, O Queen. Face me here, and I will defeat you myself.
Conversation/Zerg06/Line00012=An illusion? Are you afraid to face me, Templar?

Conversation/Zerg07/Line00004=No. He will not! The Protoss have devised some new attack. An attack powerful enough to nullify our reincarnation and give pause to the Overmind itself!
Conversation/Zerg07/Line00005=So. Tassadar's plan was merely a diversion. I should not have underestimated him so.
Conversation/Zerg07/Line00006=Without its master, Zasz's Brood has run amok and even now threatens the Hive cluster. Cerebrate, you must eradicate the rampaging Brood and stem any further damage it might cause. I shall deal with the Protoss myself.

Conversation/Zerg08/Line00002=Yet shall their overweening pride be their downfall. For when the assassin Zeratul murdered Zasz, his mind touched with mine, and all his secrets were made known to me. I have taken from his mind the secret location of Aiur, the Protoss Homeworld.

Conversation/ZergX01/Line00006=Always.
Conversation/ZergX01/Line00007=Heh. When I contacted you both on Aiur, I told you about the new Overmind and about the UED that seeks to control it. Well, the UED has done it. They've tamed the Overmind and now control most of the Zerg broods in this sector. That's why I've asked for your help.
Conversation/ZergX01/Line00008=You want us to help you defeat the UED so that you alone will rule the Zerg!
Conversation/ZergX01/Line00009=Wrong, Fenix. I want to defeat them because if we don't, they'll clamp down on this sector, and enslave us all! You know I'm right Jim. You've studied the history of Earth, you know what the UED's agenda is. Taking control of the Zerg is only the beginning for them.
Conversation/ZergX01/Line00010=Maybe... I don't know...
Conversation/ZergX01/Line00011=My Queen, again I beg your pardon for this interruption, but we have a very serious problem!

Conversation/ZergX02/Line00011=Remember the Confederate Psi Disrupter that you could never find? Well, the UED found it. And it's preventing me from controlling my minions. With the help of your Psi Emitters, I can gather up enough Zerg to destroy the Disrupter and confront the UED.
Conversation/ZergX02/Line00012=And what are you offering me in return?
Conversation/ZergX02/Line00013=Hah. Ever the politician. All right, 'Emperor', if you help me destroy the Disrupter, I'll help you retake Korhal from the UED.

Conversation/ZergX02/Line00015=The only thing I can assure you of, Arcturus, is that without my help, you'll be the Emperor of your own little eight by eight cell for the rest of your life.

Conversation/ZergX02/Line00017=All right boys and girls, listen up! Our objective is to locate and disable the Psi Disrupter's primary power generator. Once we've done that, we'll turn the mission over to Mengsk and Kerrigan. Let's move out!
Conversation/ZergX02/Line00018=The Psi Emitter will be carried by one of my SCV's. With the Disrupter's power cut, the Emitter should be able to get the attention of any renegade Zerg near it. The SCV will then be able to lure the Zerg back to your base. Once the Zerg arrive there, you'll be able to assert direct control over them.
Conversation/ZergX02/Line00019=In transit, HQ.
Conversation/ZergX02/Line00020=Good work, Jim.
Conversation/ZergX02/Line00021=I'm gone...
Conversation/ZergX02/Line00022=Go, go, go!
Conversation/ZergX02/Line00023=Perfect! With these Zerg I can construct a new hive cluster! Once my forces have grown strong enough, I can assault the Psi Disrupter directly!
Conversation/ZergX02/Line00024=Excellent work! Although these Zerg are now under my control, I sense that there are more Zerg out there. We must lure as many of them here as possible!
Conversation/ZergX02/Line00025=Um, with all due respect to miss Kerrigan, sir... these critters make me nervous as hell! I sure would appreciate some immediate evac.
Conversation/ZergX02/Line00026=Kerrigan, the generator's offline. You can send down the Psi Emitter at any time.

Conversation/ZergX03/Group00003=Throw down with the best
Conversation/ZergX03/Group00004=Hatchery Complete
Conversation/ZergX03/Group00005=Terran CC destroyed
Conversation/ZergX03/Group00006=Victory
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00001=Now that the Psi Disrupter has been destroyed and Kerrigan has regained control of her minions, I fear that she will forget our pact and turn on us.
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00002=I know what you mean, Fenix. I'd love to believe that she's on the level, but there's a part of me that just knows better. However, I do believe that she's serious about taking out the UED. The only real question left is what happens to us when she wins.
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00003=If you ask me, she's completely untrustworthy. But, so long as she'll help me retake Korhal, I'll work with her.
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00004=Shut up, Arcturus. If I wanted your damn opinion, I would've beaten it out of ya'. And in case you forgot, you're the reason she became what she is in the first place!
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00005=You boys should really learn to play nice with each other.
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00006=Kerrigan, are your forces ready to assault Korhal as we planned?
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00007=Nearly. I still need a substantial cache of resources in order to build up my primary hive clusters. I'm wondering if you gentlemen wouldn't mind going on a fuel raid for me?
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00008=It sounds like you've already got a plan. What are ya' thinkin'?
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00010=I'm thinking that we should pay the Kel-Morian Combine a little visit. Moria is one of the largest resource nodes in the sector. If you can bypass their defenses, and steal enough resources from them, we'll be able to afford a full-scale assault on Korhal.
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00011=It's risky, but I think we can handle it. Fenix, are you into this?
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00012=If it betters our chances, I will lead the assault myself.
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00013=Great. Let's get moving.
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00014=Do you think they suspect anything, my Queen?
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00015=Of course. They aren't stupid, Duran. They're siding with the evil they know over the evil they don't... They simply don't yet realize what it will cost them.
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00016=Cerebrate, I want you to infest as many Terran command centers as possible. Once they're infested, we'll be able to use them in our coming assault on Korhal.
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00017=It is difficult to believe that I am working along side my greatest enemy in order to save this sector. Fortune has been whimsical of late.
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00018=You sound like a tired old man, Fenix!
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00019=Don't let the fact that I am three hundred and sixty eight years older than you dull your impression of me, young Raynor. I can still... how do you Terrans say it... "Throw down with the best of them!"
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00020=I stand corrected.
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00021=Remember, Cerebrate, we'll need at least fifteen thousand units of crystals to maintain the hive clusters. Don't come back with anything less!
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00022=It is strange that this Kel-Morian Combine continues to operate while the UED grips the Dominion with an iron fist. I'll never underestimate the motivational effects of Terran greed again!
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00023=I prefer large scale battles over these covert missions. My heart longs for the epic struggles of my youth, to go into battle alongside my Protoss brethren again. Ah, but time will tell all things.
Conversation/ZergX03/Line00024=Kerrigan, we have reached our resource quota, and will be returning to Tarsonis.
Conversation/ZergX04/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/ZergX04/Group00002=Pet Zerg
Conversation/ZergX04/Group00003=Victory
Conversation/ZergX04/Line00001=You have all performed superbly. Especially you, Fenix. My hive clusters are brimming with energy and my broods are stronger than ever.
Conversation/ZergX04/Line00002=Then let's waste no time! Every moment we sit here means that the UED's defenses will be that much stronger! And I want nothing to stand between us and the retaking of my planet!
Conversation/ZergX04/Line00003=You're right, Arcturus. The time to strike the UED is now. But remember that we're up against one of the most heavily defended planets in the sector. Laying siege to Korhal won't be easy. Not only does the UED control a substantial standing army, but may have Zerg reinforcements as well.<n/><n/>Raynor, you and Fenix will strike at the more outlying fortification, while my forces are busy assaulting the main UED base at Augustgrad.
Conversation/ZergX04/Line00004=We've discussed this plan a hundred times! Commence the damn attack!
Conversation/ZergX04/Line00005=Hah... Very well, Arcturus. Before the next sunrise, Korhal will be yours once again.
Conversation/ZergX04/Line00006=As I suspected... The UED has sent its pet Zerg to reinforce their troops. But strangely enough, there aren't very many Zerg attacking. Maybe the UED is having more difficulty controlling the Overmind than I thought?
Conversation/ZergX04/Line00007=Excellent work, my Cerebrate! The UED's defenses are broken. Arcturus, you may take possession of this world with my blessings.
Conversation/ZergX04/Line00008=Don't be snide, Kerrigan. This was part of the deal, remember? I've earned this... I am Emperor of the Dominion again! I'll be sending General Duke to establish my base of operations in Augustgrad.
Conversation/ZergX04/Line00009=I hope you make the most of your reign...
Conversation/ZergX05/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/ZergX05/Group00002=Surprise Ends
Conversation/ZergX05/Group00003=Duke Confronted
Conversation/ZergX05/Group00004=Duke Dies
Conversation/ZergX05/Group00005=Fenix Confronted
Conversation/ZergX05/Group00006=Fenix Dies
Conversation/ZergX05/Group00007=Victory
Conversation/ZergX05/Group00008=Disablad
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00001=Cerebrate, Duran, the time has come to separate the chaff from the wheat. Now that the UED's power base is broken on this world, only their forces on Char pose any significant threat to me. It's time to move to the second phase of my plan.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00002=And what of your allies here on Korhal, my Queen? What would you have done with them?
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00003=They are of no further use to me. Though they have proven themselves useful, it might be dangerous to allow them to live. Without the services of General Duke, Mengsk will be easy to deal with. But Raynor and Fenix are uncannily resourceful.<n/><n/>They must all be eradicated. Cerebrate, I want both General Duke's and Fenix's bases destroyed. Leave no one alive.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00004=My Queen, if I may suggest a strategy? Both the Protoss and Terran forces are resting after our previous victory. If we attack immediately, while most of them are asleep and unaware, we can whittle down their defenses with relative ease!
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00005=Clever. How long after our initial attack can we expect them to regroup and retaliate?
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00006=I'd say in 6 minutes.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00007=That only gives us enough time to launch a surprise attack against one base. But it is a sound plan. Cerebrate, feel free to launch your initial attack against either base. Failure is not an option. Slaughter them all in my name!
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00008=All units prepare for retaliation! Kerrigan caught us with our pants down, but it's time to start givin' some back!
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00009=Continue your attack, Cerebrate. Their defenses won't last long against us.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00010=Well, well, well. If it isn't little Kerrigan. I had a feeling we'd be meeting each other again. You've got a lot to answer for, little girl.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00011=General Duke. You know I always wanted to have you killed. This is kind of exciting for me.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00012=Do your worst then, girl. You ain't taking Edmund Duke without a fight!
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00013=Kerrigan, you murdering bitch! We had a deal!
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00014=Oh, come on, Arcturus. Did you really think I'd allow you to come into power again? You practically fed me to the Zerg on Tarsonis! You're directly responsible for the hell I've been through! Did you honestly think I'd let you get away with that?
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00015=But you said revenge was secondary to defeating the UED!
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00016=I lied. I liberated this planet because it was the UED's primary staging point, not because I was under any obligation to you. I used you to destroy the Psi Disrupter, and now that I've got my Broods back, you're no longer necessary for my plans.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00017=I think I'll leave you here, Arcturus, among the ashes of your precious Dominion. I want you to live to see me rise to power. And I want you to always remember in your most private moments that it was you who turned me loose in the first place.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00018=This is a betrayal most foul, Kerrigan. We were fools to have gone along with this charade.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00019=You're right, Fenix. I used you to get the job done, and you played along just like I knew you would. You Protoss are all so headstrong and predictable, you are your own worst enemies.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00020=That's ironic. I can remember Tassadar teaching you a very similar lesson on Char.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00021=I took that lesson to heart, Praetor. Now, are you ready to die a second time?
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00022=The Khala awaits me, Kerrigan. And although I am prepared to face my destiny, you'll not find me easy prey!
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00023=Then that shall be your epitaph.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00024=Fenix! No!
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00025=What are you about worried, Jim? He died the way all Protoss hope to, in combat!
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00026=He died because you betrayed him. How many more noble souls do you need to consume before you're satisfied? How many more people need to die before you realize what you've become?
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00027=You don't even know what you're talking about, Jim!
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00028=Don't I? I'll see you dead for this, Kerrigan. For Fenix and all the others who got caught between you and your mad quest for power!
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00029=Tough talk, Jimmy. But I don't think you have what it takes to be a killer.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00030=It may not be tomorrow, darlin'. It may not even happen with an army at my back. But rest assured: I'm the man who's going to kill you some day. I'll be seein' you.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00031=It is done, Cerebrate. They've all been destroyed. Let us return to Tarsonis to rest. For the first time since my transfiguration I am... wearied of the slaughter.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00032=I'd say in 3 minutes.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00033=I'd say in 4 minutes.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00034=I'd say in 5 minutes.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00035=I'd say in 7 minutes.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00036=I'd say in 8 minutes.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00037=I'd say in 9 minutes.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00038=I'd say in 10 minutes.
Conversation/ZergX05/Line00039=I lied. I liberated this planet because it was the UED's primary staging point, not because I was under any obligation to you. I used you to destroy the Psi Disrupter, and now that I've got my Broods back, you're no longer necessary for my plans. I think I'll leave you here, Arcturus, among the ashes of your precious Dominion. I want you to live to see me rise to power. And I want you to always remember in your most private moments that it was you who turned me loose in the first place.
Conversation/ZergX06/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/ZergX06/Group00002=Terran Spotted
Conversation/ZergX06/Line00001=My Queen, our scouts have just discovered a massive wave of Zerg in high orbit. Hundreds of Zerg have landed upon Tarsonis and are even now approaching our location! A number of our outposts are already under attack by the renegade Swarm!
Conversation/ZergX06/Line00002=So, the UED is testing out their control of their pet Overmind. I had hoped to lay low after we razed Korhal, but it seems the UED is intent on forcing my hand.
Conversation/ZergX06/Line00003=Shall I rally your forces, my Queen?
Conversation/ZergX06/Line00004=Yes. We've got to defend our remaining outposts and make sure that the renegades can't gain a foothold in our immediate vicinity. Once we've secured our perimeter, we'll begin to take the fight to their hive clusters.
Conversation/ZergX06/Line00005=My Queen, we have located a small Terran facility towards the rear of the Renegade's landing zone. There appears to be a number of UED scientists working within the compound, but we are unable to determine the purpose of their presence.
Conversation/ZergX06/Line00006=I know what they're up to. I suspected that the UED's control of the Overmind was tenous. Tarsonis is too remote for them to maintain direct control over the Swarms, so they've sent these 'scientists' to coordinate their attack.
Conversation/ZergX06/Line00007=Cerebrate, focus your attack against the Terran facility. All of the UED scientists must be killed. Only then will we be able to finish off these Renegade Zerg.
Conversation/ZergX07/Group00001=Briefing
Conversation/ZergX07/Group00002=Beacon
Conversation/ZergX07/Group00003=Victory
Conversation/ZergX07/Line00001=Cerebrate, it's time we returned to Shakuras. I have some unfinished business with the Dark Templar Matriarch, Raszagal. I'll need to steal her from her tribe before we can finally assault the Overmind on Char. However, her defenders will not simply allow us to take her away.
Conversation/ZergX07/Line00002=The pylon clusters are generating some sort of electromagnetic field that is preventing our flyers from maneuvering. We won't have any air support at all.
Conversation/ZergX07/Line00003=Then we'll need some new strategy...
Conversation/ZergX07/Line00004=Perhaps it would be best if we staged some kind of diversion, my Queen, and claimed the Matriarch during the confusion.
Conversation/ZergX07/Line00005=What did you have in mind, Duran?
Conversation/ZergX07/Line00006=The Protoss outpost of Talematros is built upon a large mesa and is essentially impregnable to ground attacks. However, Talematros is fueled and supported by a number of adjacent pylon clusters. I believe that if we can cause a surge within those pylon clusters, we can cause Talematros' power grids to overload. The resulting explosion will be the perfect cover for retrieving the Matriarch.
Conversation/ZergX07/Line00007=Clean, simple, devious. I like it. Make it happen Duran. Cerebrate, you'll provide cover for Duran as he infiltrates the pylon clusters. Let nothing stand in our way!
Conversation/ZergX07/Line00008=Pylon cluster set to overload.
Conversation/ZergX07/Line00009=Charges set!
Conversation/ZergX07/Line00010=This cluster is ready to overload!
Conversation/ZergX07/Line00012=My Queen, the last charge is set. Talematros will explode on your command.
Conversation/ZergX07/Line00013=Very well. Cerebrate, send my minions down to the planet and have them retrieve the Matriarch. Duran, ignite the charges!
Conversation/ZergX07/Line00014=Ignition commencing.

Conversation/ZergX08/Group00004=Disable
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00001=The time is finally upon us, my minions, to destroy the wretched Overmind and the last of its Renegade Cerebrates.  We can count on the UED providing us with heavy resistance, but not even they can stand in our way.  Now that the Matriarch, Raszagal is in my custody, I possess the means to attack the Overmind with impunity.
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00002=But my Queen, I thought only the Dark Templar's energies could harm the Overmind and its Cerebrates.  Even with the numerous Broods at your command, any attack we launch against the Renegades will be in vain.
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00003=Not so, Duran.  As a matter of fact, I'm expecting my secret weapon to be arriving very soon.
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00004=As you say, my Queen.  But I still don't understand wh-  <n/><n/>We are receiving a transmission from an unidentified Protoss Carrier...
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00005=That's what I love about the Protoss... They're so punctual.
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00006=Kerrigan, this is Zeratul.  I demand to know why you've taken our Matriarch.
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00007=Actually, Zeratul, she's not the one I'm truly interested in.  I stole her to get to you.  You see, I need you and your brethren to kill the Overmind for me.  The only way I had of assuring your cooperation was to take away that which you value most.  However, I give you my word that once you've killed the Overmind, I'll allow her to return to you.
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00008=As if your word held any value...
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00009=Zeratul, my faithful servant.  You must aid Kerrigan in this endeavor.  The Overmind is our common enemy.  It must be destroyed to insure that our people will survive!
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00010=You ask me to aid this vile creature?
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00011=I do not ask this for myself.  Nor do I ask it on Kerrigan's behalf.  I ask you to do this for our people, Zeratul.  Obey me as you always have... Trust in my judgement.
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00012=Very well, Matriarch.  The Overmind will die this day.
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00013=There are a number of Terran science facilities positioned around the Overmind itself. I believe these facilities are directing the Overmind's strategies just as they did on Tarsonis.
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00014=It is done, Kerrigan. The Overmind is dead, as you wished. Now, I demand that you release the Matriarch at once!
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00015=Of course. Raszagal, do you wish to return to your tribe?
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00016=No, my Queen. I wish only to serve you and remain at your side.
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00017=What treachery is this, Kerrigan? This pathetic creature cannot possibly be Raszagal!
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00018=Ha ha ha. I promised that I'd allow her to return to you, Zeratul. But it looks to me like she doesn't want to go.
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00019=You have corrupted her! Somehow, you have poisoned her thoughts. Restore her to her rightful self, or you will pay dearly for this offense, Kerrigan!
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00020=All right, Zeratul, you've got me. I made your Matriarch my slave long before I joined you on Shakuras. She made the mistake of underestimating my power just like everyone else did. And now she's paid the price.<n/>With her as my puppet I was able to eradicate the Renegades on Shakuras, and use you to kill the Overmind. And as you can see, your leader belongs to me now. Not bad, huh?
Conversation/ZergX08/Line00021=We shall see, Kerrigan. We shall see.

Conversation/ZergX09/Group00003=Victory
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00001=My Queen, with the Overmind and its cerebrates destroyed, all of the Zerg in this sector have reverted to your direct control. The remnants of the UED fleet have fled the planet, but I have no idea how many functional ships they still possess. <n/><n/>We have finished relocating your primary hive clusters to this orbital platform. However, we do have a problem. Somehow, Zeratul and his brethren were able to bypass our defenses and steal their Matriarch away from us.
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00002=Damn Zeratul! He is a formidable adversary. Where have they run to, Duran?
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00003=Our scouts report that they have regrouped with a number of Protoss survivors on the surface of Char. The Matriarch is being held within a stasis cell, leading me to suspect that the Protoss will attempt to take her home to Shakuras.
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00004=Heh. They still believe that she can be saved from my influence... Zeratul will be very disappointed to learn that Raszagal is beyond redemption. How much time before their fleet is ready to debark for Shakuras?
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00005=They will be capable of dimensional recall within thirty minutes, my Queen.
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00006=That may be all the time we need. Cerebrate, mobilize all of my broods and send them to the surface of Char. I want you to bring both the Matriarch and  Zeratul to me alive. Terminate the remaining Protoss with extreme prejudice.
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00007=My Queen, the Cerebrate was too slow! The Protoss are escaping!
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00008=Damn you, Kerrigan, for what I must do!
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00009=Thank you, Zeratul... You have freed me from her vile control at last. You have always served me with honor... Thus I must ask you... to watch over my tribe... Into your hands I give the future.
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00010=I can hardly believe this! You've killed your own Matriarch!
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00011=Better that I killed her, than let her live as your slave, Kerrigan.
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00012=Well, I have misjudged you, warrior. You are worthy, indeed. You are free to go.
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00013=What?
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00014=I said, you are free to go. I've already taken your honor. I'll let you live, because I know that from now on, your every waking moment will be torture. You'll never be able to forgive yourself for what I've forced you to do. And that, Zeratul, is a better revenge than I could have ever dreamed of.
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00015=You will regret this decision, Kerrigan. We shall meet again.
Conversation/ZergX09/Line00016=Your violence, young Kerrigan, is typical.  As is your inability to comprehend the greater scheme of things...

Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00001=My friends, we have suffered a great defeat. Our Matriarch is dead, our fleets have been scattered across the Astral Winds, and Kerrigan has gained complete control over the Zerg Swarms.<n/><n/>Yet as always, we must struggle onward. Our immediate priority is to find Artanis and his warriors. Once we have made contact with him we can return to Shakuras and plan our next moves.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00002=Prelate Zeratul, we are currently tracking Protoss power signatures emanating from an uncharted moon nearby. Our records do not indicate that there has ever been a Protoss settlement in this quadrant.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00003=Strange. It could be Artanis or other survivors of our fleet down there. At any rate, it is our duty to investigate the source of the energy signatures. Set your course for the dark moon. If Artanis is there, we shall find him.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00004=Zeratul, our sensors have detected a small Terran compound near the source of the energy signatures.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00005=Understood. I'll look into this matter myself.

Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00009=Damn! The Terrans are having more trouble utilizing Pylons than I thought. And I still have no clue as to why they had imprisoned that Protoss within the cell.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00010=As I suspected... There are more stasis cells here.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00011=There is a Protoss within this cell as well. Maybe this computer terminal can give me the answers I seek.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00012=Test subject twenty five in cryo-hybernation. Neuro-scan compiling data. DNA code computed and archived. Psionic emanations minimal...
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00013=The audacity of these Terrans confounds me! If they seek to know more about Protoss warriors, I will give them a first hand lesson!
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00014=What's this? There is a Zergling in this tank! What is going on here?
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00015=Test subject twenty seven in cryo-hybernation. Neuro-scan completed and archived. DNA code computed and archived. Gene splicing between test subjects twenty five and twenty seven completed. Experiment 2273 progressing...
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00016=By the gods... this can't be happening.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00017=I've... I've never seen a creature like this before...
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00018=Test subject twenty nine, classified: Protoss/Zerg Hybrid, in perfect cryo-hybernation. Psionic emanations minimal.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00019=No...
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00020=Magnificent, isn't it?
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00021=What? Who are you?
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00022=I've had many names throughout the millennia, young prodigal. You would know me best as Samir Duran.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00023=Kerrigan's consort! Is this part of her twisted schemes?
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00024=No. Young Kerrigan could not have engineered this grand experiment. Although her rebirth into the Zerg Swarm has sped up my progress, I can assure you that this endeavor is quite beyond her narrow understanding.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00025=If you are not her pawn, then what are you?
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00026=I am a servant of a far greater power. A power that has slept for countless ages. And is reflected in the creature within that cell.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00027=Have you any conception of what you've created here? Do you have any idea what this... this Hybrid is capable of?
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00028=Of course I do. This creature is the completion of a cycle. Its role in the cosmic order was preordained when the stars were young. Behold the culmination of your history.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00029=All I behold is an abomination.
Conversation/ZergX09s/Line00030=Your violence, young prodigal, is typical. As is your inability to comprehend the greater scheme of things. You can destroy all of the specimens here. It will do you no good. For I have seeded the Hybrid on many, many worlds. You will never find them all before they awaken. And when they do... your universe will be changed... forever.

Conversation/ZergX10/Group00004=P4 Defeat
Conversation/ZergX10/Group00005=Extra Hero Banter
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00001=Cerebrate, our scouts have just identified three separate fleets approaching this platform. With Duran having disappeared, and the bulk of my broods still on the surface of Char, you'll need to hold off the invaders by yourself.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00002=You sound worried, Kerrigan. Have I caught you at a bad time?
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00003=Not at all, Arcturus. How'd you manage to scrape up your new fleet? Been raiding the salvage dumps again?
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00004=I called in a few favors. Made a few concessions. You'd be surprised to see how many special interest groups in this sector want to see you dead.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00005=I'm sorry to have to disappoint your new friends, Arcturus. But you really shouldn't have attempted this stunt. It'll take more than your three little fleets to bring me down.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00006=Three fleets?
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00007=Don't play dumb, Arcturus. I've already spotted the other two fleets.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00008=Kerrigan, this is Artanis. My brethren and I have come to avenge the deaths of Fenix, the Matriarch, and all of the other Protoss who fell before the Swarm! It is long past time you paid for your crimes against our people.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00009=When it rains, it pours...
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00010=Hah ha ha... The Protoss, too! Care to take a guess as to who the third fleet is?
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00011=No need to guess. It's DuGalle and the remainder of the UED fleet.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00012=That is correct, Kerrigan. This is Admiral DuGalle. I am giving you one last chance to surrender your forces, and submit to the sovereign authority of the United Earth Directorate.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00013=Gee, that's a tough one, Admiral. You'll have let me think for a minute... You know, Admiral, I think I'll just massacre your remaining troops now and watch you die in agony. How would that be?
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00014=You vastly underestimate me, my dear.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00015=I don't think so, Admiral. You see, at this point... I'm pretty much the Queen Bitch of the Universe. And not all of your little soldiers or space ships will stand in my way again.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00016=So be it.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00017=Kerrigan, I am prepared to offer terms of surrender. It is my wish that you allow my men to live.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00018=You're not in a position to offer me anything, Admiral. And I don't take prisoners. I'll tell you what... Turn your remaining ships around and start heading back towards the Earth. I'll even let you have a head start, before I send the Swarms after you. I
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00019=Congratulations, Kerrigan. You've beaten me again. Just remember that I'll be out there... Waiting for you to slip up.  Because sooner or later you'll make a mistake. And when you do...
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00020=Savor this victory, Kerrigan! For the Protoss will never forget your treachery. We shall be watching you.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00021=The time for action is upon us while the Zerg still muster their forces.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00022=Executor, prepare our forces.  We have a friend to kill…
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00023=I can scarcely believe this!
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00024=Kerrigan!  Do not force us to destroy you.  You will be hopelessly outnumbered.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00025=I expect results!
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00026=You vastly underestimate me!
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00027=Try not to be so careless in the future.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00028=No…
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00029=The time of our final strike is close at hand.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00030=Have I caught you at a bad time?
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00031=Do it…and I know just the way…
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00032=You'll regret that.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00033=You're making a terrible mistake.  We are not going to falter!
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00034=Don't be snide Kerrigan!
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00035=Admiral DuGalle…
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00036=Arcturus…
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00037=Heh…
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00038=Ha!
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00039=Perfect…
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00040=Their defenses won't last long against us.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00041=I don't think so Admiral.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00042=Cerebrate, our scouts have just identified three separate fleets approaching this platform. With Duran having disappeared, and the bulk of my broods still on the surface of Char, we'll need to hold off the invaders together.
Conversation/ZergX10/Line00043=Abandon your fear.  Redemption is at hand. Your universe will be freed of its suffering.
Conversation/cinematic_protoss2/Group00001=protoss2
Conversation/cinematic_protoss2/Line00001=Hey Sergeant! Sarge! Hey!
Conversation/cinematic_protoss2/Line00002=You will immediately tell me why you have called me from my desk, private!
Conversation/cinematic_protoss2/Line00003=Protoss unit, Sarge! Coming through the south pass! It looks broke.
Conversation/cinematic_protoss2/Line00004=Kill it!
Conversation/cinematic_protoss2/Line00005=Fire.
Conversation/cinematic_protoss2/Line00006=Yeah! Oh yeah! Feel that hot love right up your tail pipe.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Group00001=starintr
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00001=I can't see a thing, Jem.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00002=Well hold on.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00003=I swear it's always some damn thing.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00004=Wait...got it.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00005=Ah hell, this thing ain't gonna hold.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00006=Shut up...
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00007=Damn you're ugly.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00008=You girls strapped in nice and tight now?
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00009=Tighter than your mama's ass!
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00010=That's a good one man.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00011=Locked in and cruisin'.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00012=What you got for me out there, Joeyray?
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00013=We got Terran for sure, I don't know about the rest...
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00014=We got a big old butt load of floating debris out here, Jem.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00015=Woooeee! We hit pay dirt this time for sure.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00016=Explain to me how we're going to get all of this home.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00017=Yeah...
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00018=I'm detached and moving toward the derelict spacecraft.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00019=Damn it Jem, video's out again.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00020=Well quit picking at it.
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00021=I aint pick'n at it, damn it! I'm out here with a hitch of my getty-up
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00022=--are you listening to me?
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00023=Hold on, I got visual...
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00024=its a damn bogey 12 o'clock,
Conversation/cinematic_starintr/Line00025=right behind the ship, right behind you Jem!
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Group00001=starxintr
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00001=Who's in charge here? 
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00002=Where is the air support? 
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00003=So,
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00004=Gerard,
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00005=I suspect you have a good reason for pulling me away from my... duties.
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00006=Your vodka can wait, my good Alexei.
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00007=Come, stand here. You need to see this.
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00008=I know all about the Zerg, Gerard...
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00009=We've all seen the tapes a hundred-
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00010=You've seen nothing! Dissecting a dead Zerg in a lab is one thing, unleashing them on men is another.
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00011=You must go into this with both eyes open. 
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00012=Once started, there is no going back.
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00013=Are you prepared to go all the way with this, Alexei?
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00014=Yes...
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00015=Yes, I am prepared to go all the way,
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00016=my good Admiral.
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00017=Good, good. I knew I could count on you. 
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00018=Admiral. The colonists' base will be overrun in a matter of minutes. Shall we intervene? 
Conversation/cinematic_starxintr/Line00019=Take us into orbit, Mr. Malmsteen. We've seen enough. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran1/Group00001=terran1
Conversation/cinematic_terran1/Line00001=Hey Sarge, why we always got to listen to this shit for anyway?
Conversation/cinematic_terran1/Line00002=Cause I'm in charge, that's why.
Conversation/cinematic_terran1/Line00003=Oh that don't seem like no good kind of reason to me, you ain't the boss of me anyway...
Conversation/cinematic_terran1/Line00004=hey, what's that?
Conversation/cinematic_terran1/Line00005=Hood ornament in a second. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran1/Line00006=Steam roller!
Conversation/cinematic_terran1/Line00007=Looks like you mashed some poor fella's dog, Sarge.
Conversation/cinematic_terran1/Line00008=It's a Zergling, Lester... smaller type o' Zerg. He wouldn't be out this far, unless... oh shit.
Conversation/cinematic_terran1/Line00009=I love you, Sarge... 
Conversation/cinematic_terran3/Group00001=terran3
Conversation/cinematic_terran3/Line00001=So I says, 'Answer that and stay fashionable..' 
Conversation/cinematic_terran3/Line00002=It's not funny anymore Harley. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran3/Line00003=All right, cut the chatter ladies. Drop your socks and grab your throttle. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran3/Line00004=Confederate platform verified and locked. This one's all yours, Harley... 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Group00001=terran4
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00001=Fellow Terrans, 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00002=I come to you in the wake of recent events to issue a call to reason. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00003=Let no human deny the perils of our time.
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00004=While we battle one another, divided by the petty strife of our common history, The tide of greater conflict is turning against us. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00005=Threatening to destroy all that we have accomplished. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00006=It is time for us as nations and as individuals to set aside our long-standing feuds and unite. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00007=The tides of an unwinnable war are upon us and we must seek refuge on higher ground lest we be swept away by the flood. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00008=The Confederacy is no more.
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00009=Whatever semblance of unity and protection it once provided is a phantom, a memory. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00010=With our enemies left unchecked, who will you turn to for protection? 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00011=The devastation wrought by the alien invaders is self-evident. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00012=We have seen our homes and communities destroyed by the calculated blows of the Protoss. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00013=We have seen first hand our friends and loved ones consumed by the nightmarish Zerg. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00014=Unprecedented and unimaginable though they may be, these are the signs of our time. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00015=The time has come, my fellow Terrans, to rally to a new banner.
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00016=In unity lies strength; already many of the dissident factions have joined us.
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00017=Out of the many we shall forge an indivisible whole capitulating only to a single throne. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00018=And from that throne I shall watch over you. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00019=From this day forward let no human make war upon any other human, 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00020=Let no Terran agency conspire against this new beginning. 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00021=And let no man consort with alien powers... 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00022=and to all the enemies of humanity: seek not to bar our way, 
Conversation/cinematic_terran4/Line00023=For we shall win through, no matter the cost!
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Group00001=xterran
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00001=Zerg! 
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00002=The very mention of this terrifying race once brought fear to all who heard it.
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00003=But now we can all rest easy, as our own forces now occupy their very homeworld of Char.
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00004=Months have passed since our initial confrontation with the Zerg. 
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00005=And now Directorate forces have taken control of the planet Char, long since rumored to cradle the malevolent Overmind of the Zerg. 
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00006=The Overmind itself, an enormous living brain-like entity, dictates control of all the myriad Zerg forces,
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00007=and it was believed to be planning an invasion on the Earth itself!
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00008=Once on the offensive, our highly trained Directorate forces were more than a match for the beast-like Zerg. 
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00009=Even their fiercest warrior breed could not defeat the greatest military technology in the galaxy. 
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00010=The Zerg forces on Char were completely decimated, and their losses were tallied in the millions.
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00011=But all wars have casualties, and while Directorate losses were minimal, the fleet's Vice Admiral Stukov gave his life during the final valiant assault on Char.
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00012=Memorial services were held aboard the Directorate flagship Aleksander.
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00013=Vice Admiral Stukov truly knew the meaning of sacrifice.
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00014=Yet his sacrifice was not in vain. The Overmind itself was the prize of the battle.
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00015=Even now Directorate Psychics and powerful drugs are keeping the creature pacified. 
Conversation/cinematic_xterran/Line00016=The Overmind will undergo extensive research to insure the continued safety of the United Earth Directorate and of all mankind!
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Group00001=xzerg
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00001=Once again I stand atop the broken bodies of my enemies... 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00002=Victorious but not unscarred. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00003=The Earth-borne Directorate has been destroyed. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00004=And the Overmind lies dead and trampled beneath the ashes of Char. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00005=As for my unlikely allies, I think that I shall allow them a reprieve. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00006=For in time I will seek to test their resolve, and their strengths. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00007=They will all be mine in the end, for I am the Queen of Blades. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00008=None shall ever dispute my rule again. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00009=Dearest Helena, 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00010=By now the news of our defeat has reached the Earth. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00011=The creatures we were sent here to tame are un-tamable. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00012=And the colonies we were sent to reclaim have proven to be stronger than we anticipated. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00013=Whatever you may hear about what has happened out here, know this; 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00014=Alexei did not die gloriously in battle. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00015=I killed him.
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00016=My pride killed him. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00017=And now my pride has consumed me as well. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00018=You will never see me again, Helena.
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00019=Tell our children that I love them, 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00020=and that their father died in defense of their future. 
Conversation/cinematic_xzerg/Line00021=Au revoir. 
Conversation/cinematic_zerg1/Group00001=zerg1
Conversation/cinematic_zerg1/Line00001=Jim... Jim... 
Conversation/cinematic_zerg2/Group00001=zerg2
Conversation/cinematic_zerg2/Line00001=Thank God for cold fusion!
Conversation/cinematic_zerg2/Line00002=Hey, are we really going to blow this place? 
Conversation/cinematic_zerg2/Line00003=Only if we see a Zerg... 
Conversation/cinematic_zerg2/Line00004=Yeah, I got your Zerg right here... 
Conversation/cinematic_zerg2/Line00005=Behind you!
Conversation/cinematic_zerg2/Line00006=We're hosed, man! blow it...Blow it!
